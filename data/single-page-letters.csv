SPEECH TO THE INSTITUTE OF BANKERS, FRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER

I attach a draft speech which concentrates on monetary policy
but contains also a section prepared by Mr Hancock on exchange
controls.  The material may not be entirely consistent with
the latest version of tomorrow's statement, and has not yet
been checked in detail with the Bank.  Some changes may be
necessary on both accounts.  Topping and tailing will, of
course, also be necessary.

2.  I also attach a section by Mr Brendon Sewill on the method
of payment of wages which he has suggested might be included
in the speech.  It does not fit easily into the speech as
currently drafted, and the Bank have not yet seen it, but you
may wish for it to be woven in.",1979-11-15,C J RILEY,Chancellor,Speech to the Institute of Bankers,Letter,PREM 19-34/0001/-39.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses matters related to monetary policy and exchange controls, which fall under the remit of the HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry.",1979-12-13

"Turning to the borrowing requirement for this year, the Prime Minister said that renewed efforts must be made to reduce it. She agreed with the Chancellor that a new fiscal package should be ruled out; but there was a case for going harder on sales of assets, and also for reducing the borrowing of the nationalised industries. As regards the latter, she wondered whether new steps could not be taken to recover some of the lost revenue caused by the telephone billing dispute; could subscribers be given a small discount on their bills if they paid early? The Chancellor commented that on practical grounds, he did not think assets sales could be pursued much further during the current financial year; and in any case, any further sales would not be all that helpful for the money supply because they would be -- to some extent -- substitutes for sales of gilts.

In conclusion, the Prime Minister re-emphasised that alternative options to a further increase in MLR should be examined very urgently. She would meet the Chancellor, the Chief Secretary, the Financial Secretary, the Governor and senior officials tomorrow to discuss the position further.

Exchange Controls

The Chancellor said that a decision would have to be taken within the next few weeks on the further dismantling of exchange controls. A firm decision one way or the other was needed partly in connection with the sale of BP shares. His own preliminary view was that the remaining controls should be dismantled.

The Prime Minister said that she would be glad to discuss this after the Chancellor returned from the IMF/Bank meetings: but her initial view was that there should be no further relaxation for the time being. She felt that it would be a mistake to relax the controls further until the Government's market philosophy was being seen to work. To move any further now could all too easily lead to a large outflow of funds.

From the Private Secretary

25 September 1979

Dear Martin,

The Prime Minister gave a lunch yesterday for Treasury Ministers and the Governor. They had a wide-ranging discussion. The following is a summary of some of the points covered.

The Domestic Monetary Situation

The Governor said that the monetary prospect was now a little more encouraging. This was for three reasons. First, the Government's funding requirements would be rather lower over the next few months. Secondly, while lending to the private sector was still strong, there were signs that it might begin to edge down soon. Some of the recent lending had been to finance early repayment of foreign currency loans, and this had increased the level of total lending over what it otherwise would have been. Thirdly, the August figures for lending to persons suggested that this category of lending was beginning to moderate.

On the other hand, there were several anxieties. In the first place, there was the engineering dispute, which was causing uncertainty in the market. Secondly, it was still possible that lending to the private sector would continue at a high level - especially if corporate liquidity worsened in response to big pay settlements. Thirdly, there was concern that sterling might fall further. Insofar as this would worsen the inflationary outlook, this would make gilt sales that much more difficult. Finally, there was pressure from rising interest rates overseas.

The Prime Minister asked whether, against this background, interest rates were likely to fall in time to avoid the increase in the mortgage rate in January. The Governor responded that, although the outlook was very uncertain, it seemed more likely that interest rates would stay up than that they would turn down soon enough.

The Prime Minister then asked whether it would not be possible to tighten the ""corset"" in order to hold back bank lending. The Governor explained that while the ""corset"" arrangements could in principle be changed so as to eliminate the existing leakages, the banks and borrowers would almost certainly find new ways of evading the controls. For example, inter-company lending would probably increase. There might also be increased borrowing from abroad. Ultimately, the authorities had to rely on interest rates to bring the level of credit creation to the private sector within the desired limits.",1979-09-25,Private Secretary,Martin,Domestic Monetary Situation,letter,PREM 19-34/0001/-191.jpg,"Prime Minister's Office, No. 10 Downing Street","The letter appears to be from the Private Secretary of the Prime Minister, discussing a meeting between the Prime Minister, Treasury Ministers and the Governor of the Bank of England.

Dear John,

MONEY SUPPLY AND ELIGIBLE LIABILITY FIGURES

The eligible liability figures and the clearing bank figures to be published tomorrow will give the market a first indication of the likely money supply figure for banking September, and also of the bank lending figures. The Chancellor thought that the Prime Minister might like to be aware of the provisional full figures, which will be published on Thursday week, 18th October, since it is possible that the market will read more into them than is justified.

As the attached note brings out, it would be risky to conclude that this is the first sign of a turndown in the bank lending figures. It may be, but it is risky to conclude this on the strength of one month's figures alone. First, the underlying reduction is probably not as much as the published figures suggest. Second, there have been monthly fluctuations in the underlying figures - in both directions - of at least as much as this in the recent past. The Chancellor will let the Prime Minister know what implications he draws for monetary policy when he has had a chance of considering these figures and the new financial forecasts with the Governor.

I am sending a copy of this letter to John Beverly at the Bank.

Financial Statement

We have rung round to reinstate the 11 o'clock start for tomorrow's Cabinet (and MISC 22 at 10.15 am).

2. The Bank of England's announcement will not be made until later in the morning. I therefore suggest that it would be convenient to get the three routine items out of the way, before you ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to tell his colleagues about the measures proposed and about the statement which he intends to make in the afternoon.

3. I daresay that, after the Chancellor has made his statement to his colleagues, you will want to make the general point that this situation underlines the implications of the fact that, painful as the process of reducing the growth of public expenditure has been, we still face in 1980-81 a figure which is no less than (on present published figures a little higher than) the figure for 1979-80 in constant terms. That will increase the importance of getting a satisfactory outcome at Dublin, which could take the 1980-81 figure below the 1979-80 figure.

4. I suggest that you should not suggest or even hint at the possibility of a further review of public expenditure for 1980-81: that could lead to defensive counter-briefing by Ministers who saw their programmes as threatened. But perhaps we do need to begin to prepare for the possibility of having to make further cuts in expenditure for 1980-81, if over the coming few months it is not possible to regain control of the monetary targets by the measures now proposed. I believe that it would be useful for you privately to ask the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary, strictly within the Treasury, to review the programmes for 1980-81 with a view to identifying options for further cuts, if further cuts had to be made. It would be useful if they could report on the results of such an exercise by Friday, 7th December, so that it would be available if needed in the following week - the week before you go to the United States.",1979-11-14,ROBERT ARMSTRONG,PRIME MINISTER,Financial Statement,Letter,PREM 19-34/0001/-93.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses financial matters, including the Bank of England's announcement, the Chancellor of the Exchequer's statement to Cabinet, and the need to review public expenditure for 1980-81.

TARGET VARIABLES

I am replying to the enquiry in your minute of 3 September to
Mr. Middleton, because I held a meeting with the Bank of England
on Friday evening to take stock of the work being done to follow
up discussion at the Prime Minister's seminar in July.

The main area to be covered is that of ""monetary base control"".
The Bank of England have agreed to take the lead in preparing
the joint papers, because we very much need for this stage of
discussion to get the analysis right in terms of institutional
and operational features of the banking system, etc. We identified
three specifications of monetary base schemes, which we think
adequate to give coverage of the spectrum of what might be
prina facie practicable or at least worth positive examination
(i.e. ruling out some of the naive extreme versions). We shall
of course go over the Bank of England work and produce joint
papers, whether fully agreed or reflecting differences of view.

A parallel exercise, which I think was not discussed at the
Prime Minister's seminar in July but would need to be mentioned
in the context of further discussion of the monetary base, is
work which the Bank are initiating on the abolition of the banking
""reserve assets ratio"", and the substitution of some more appropriate
liquidity norm for prudential purposes. They see this as something
which should be done in the early stages of application of the new
Banking Act, which certainly seems sensible. We are examining papers
they have written on this subject, and on its relationship with",1978-09-03,MR.

after 6 months.  It might, in the event, be needed for more than 6 months.  It was agreed that the Statement should be redrafted so as to leave open the possibility of its continuation beyond 6 months.

Iran and the Dollar

Finally, the Chancellor reported on a conversation he had had on the telephone during the course of the meeting with Secretary Miller.  Miller had explained the background to President Carter's order freezing official Iranian assets held in the USA and in US banks abroad, and had asked for HMG's co-operation in making the order effective.  He had responded sympathetically, and had said that HMG would certainly be willing to consider any proposals from the US authorities.

effect on bank lending in November, and indeed the full impact
will probably take some time to come through. Nevertheless
the November figure, while still substantial at about £1 billion,
was considerably less than the record October figure of
£1.2 billion, and there was virtually no further leakage of
acceptances outside the banking system. Although we hope for
some slowing down in the next few months, the trend is still
worryingly high.

5.	Although the overall money supply figure is mildly
encouraging, the components are less so. With bank lending
remaining buoyant, DCE was still high and it was only a
substantially negative external adjustment - £0.8 billion -
which brought the money supply figure down to a reasonably
satisfactory level. We cannot rely on external adjustments
of this size in the coming months, and it is important that
DCE falls further.

6.	I am reasonably confident that DCE will fall sufficiently,
and the gilt sales already achieved have helped the prospect for
December considerably. But bank lending remains the worrying
aspect of the present monetary situation, and it will be
necessary to see some falling off in this, in addition to
sustained gilt sales and a satisfactory development of Central
Government borrowing, before thinking in terms of a reduction
in interest rates.

Dear Michael

Mike Pattison wrote on 4 October enclosing a letter from the
US Ambassador to the Prime Minister conveying a message from
President Carter about financial support for the work of the
Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).

I enclose a draft reply which the Prime Minister may wish to
send.

The CGIAR consists primarily of aid donor countries and
organisations. It funds and guides the activities of 12 international agricultural research centres with the object of increasing
food production in the developing world. The Group was established
in 1971, under the co-sponsorship of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the United Nations Development Programme when it assumed
financial responsibility for the four original centres launched by
the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations (which remain among the contributors). The UK and the US were both founder members of the
Group, which has grown rapidly to its present size. It has a total
budget in 1979 of $US104 million. The UK contribution in 1979 is
£3 million - about 6% of the total. The US has traditionally contributed 25% of total requirements.

The work of the research centres funded by the CGIAR has
achieved important successes in raising the yield potential of some
of the world's major crops including rice, wheat and maize and the
Consultative Group itself has been an economical mechanism for
attracting funds and of guiding and coordinating the work of the
research centres. However, this mechanism was established at the
inception of the Group to meet the needs of a fairly modest
organisation and we believe it could benefit from some revision
before the present rate of expansion can be accelerated with confidence. It also needs to do more to help developing countries'
own research organisations to adapt the work of the centres to
local needs: this is in hand and we think has the highest priority
in any expansion.

When the Consultative Group meets in Washington at the end of
October we do not expect to be able to increase the UK pledge in
real terms, or to make a firm commitment to a five-year plan. Continued success is not simply a matter of money, but more funds could
certainly be beneficially employed, and we would not wish to discourage other donors from playing a bigger part.

I am copying this letter and enclosure to Martin Vile (Cabinet
Office).

end.  The work of CGIAR has played a significant part in
raising food production and it has had strong support from

Our support will continue taking into account both the
general limitations imposed by our economic circumstances
on the scale of our aid programme and the strains that
rapid expansion of the CGIAR system would put upon its
management structure.

Warm regards.

OUTCOME OF THE TOKYO SUMMIT :
A GERMAN VIEW

The Secretary of State received a telephone call from Count Lambsdorff this morning.  Count Lambsdorff explained that he was calling as a consequence of the Tokyo Summit. He observed that he was satisfied with the result of the meeting which gave the EEC room to manoeuvre and in particular he was grateful for the UK support for the free market economy approach to managing oil supplies.

2.  Count Lambsdorff then turned to the consequences of the Tokyo Summit.  President Giscard d'Estaing had telephoned Helmut Schmidt to seek support for his suggestion that there should be review meetings in the late summer and the autumn by the Energy Ministers of the seven Tokyo summit countries of the progress towards meeting the targets that had been set by the summit.  Schmidt's response had basically been to accept this proposal providing that it did not create a special club outside the OECD and EEC.  He thought it was important not to institutionalise the Tokyo summit, but he had no objection to reviewing its results on a regular basis.  The Secretary of State agreed with this line and said that he would wish to discuss it with his Cabinet colleagues.  I would be grateful for your advice on how we should proceed in following up this exchange.

3.  In further discussion Count Lambsdorff said that he had received no report from M. Giscard on his meeting with Sheikh Yamani.  His own official representative had reported that the outcome of the meeting had not been very impressive.  The",1979-05-09,TC Mr Franklin,MR. D. LE B.

Dear George,

Prime Minister's Conversations at a Quadripartite Breakfast at the French Embassy, Tokyo, on 29 June, 1979, and during the Prime Minister's subsequent car journey to the Akasaka Palace, Tokyo, with President Carter

On the morning of 29 June, the Prime Minister attended a quadripartite breakfast (with President Giscard, President Carter and Chancellor Schmidt) at the French Embassy in Tokyo and subsequently travelled with President Carter from the Embassy to the Akasaka Palace for the Third Session of the Economic Summit. The following is a summary of some of the points which arose during these conversations.

Middle East
President Carter said that he had been surprised by the strength of the Saudi Arabian reaction to Camp David. Earlier contacts with the Saudis had convinced him that they would acquiesce in the Camp David Agreements. The US had put much effort into maintaining close links with the Saudis and in assisting them in the defence and intelligence fields. President Carter was deeply pessimistic about future relations between the consumer countries and OPEC and about the possibility of OPEC blackmail, for example, told Premier Clark that they would withdraw all their deposits from Canada if the Canadian Government transferred their Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In the face of this threat, Mr. Clark had abandoned his intention of doing so.

President Carter had emphasised to Mr. Brezhnev, at the Vienna Summit, that the US had a special and continuing interest in the Middle East and, in particular, in the Gulf region.

President Giscard revealed that he had refused to see Colonel Ghadafi when the latter had informed him, at 24 hours' notice, that he wished to visit Paris.

All those present at the quadripartite breakfast had expressed concern over the possibility that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States would decide to reduce their oil production to a level sufficient to meet their own needs alone.",1979-07-03,From the Private Secretary,Dear George,"Prime Minister's Conversations at a Quadripartite Breakfast at the French Embassy, Tokyo, on 29 June, 1979, and during the Prime Minister's subsequent car journey to the Akasaka Palace, Tokyo, with President Carter",letter,PREM 19-28/0001/-68.jpg,"Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","The letter discusses diplomatic and international relations matters, such as the Prime Minister's conversations with world leaders about the Middle East, OPEC, and relations with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States.

"DRAFT LETTER FOR SIGNATURE BY THE PRIME MINISTER

ADDRESSED: President Carter

Thank you for your message of 4 October which
Ambassador Brewster passed to me about support for the work
of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research.

I do indeed recall the Tokyo decision to intensify our
efforts to overcome hunger in the developing countries and I
confirm the importance I attach to research on an international
co-operative basis as a contribution to this end.  The work of
CGIAR has played a significant part in raising food production and
it has had strong support from this country from the start.

Our support will continue taking into account both the
general limitations imposed by our economic circumstances on the
scale of our aid programme and the strains that rapid expansion
of the CGIAR system would put upon its management structure.",1977-10-04,Prime Minister,President Carter,Support for the work of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research,letter,PREM 19-28/0001/-08.jpg,"Prime Minister's Office, No. 10 Downing Street","The content of the letter indicates that it is addressed to the Prime Minister and relates to the Prime Minister's support for international agricultural research efforts, which falls within the remit of the Prime Minister's Office.",1977-11-01

Dear David,

NPC CONTRACT FOR CDRF DESIGN AND PROJECT ENGINEERING

Thank you for your letter of 5 July seeking approval for a 2 year extension to the end of the next financial year for the contracts for design and project engineering work on the fast reactor which the UK Atomic Energy Authority places with the Nuclear Power Company on behalf of your Department.

I am grateful to you for consulting me before entering into this expenditure commitment. I see the arguments that it is unsatisfactory to carry forward an advanced technology of this kind on such a short term basis and I accept that a 2 year contract is the best way to ensure value for money and to maintain the momentum of the research team. I also note from your letter your undertaking that the sums of money required for the contract (£4.8m in the remainder of 1979-80 and £7.7m in 1980-81) can be found from within the nuclear vote and within cash limits and would not be affected by option cuts.

However your reference to option cuts must, I think, have been written before you saw my Cabinet Paper on ""Public Expenditure, 1980-81"" (C(79)26) in which I have had to suggest a further general cut of 3 per cent on the majority of programmes, including yours, in addition to the options originally suggested.

Dear John,

Following the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Budget statement it is necessary to announce revised cash limits to take account of the specific public expenditure cuts, the effect of pay settlements, and the payments deferred from 1978-79. The Chief Secretary hopes to make this announcement on Tuesday 26 June, so that the adjusted cash limits are available to Members in advance of the Second Reading of the Finance Bill. A draft of the announcement is attached. It is cast at present in terms of an answer to a written Parliamentary Question but since delays in the production of Hansard may prevent its becoming available to Members quickly in that form, it may as an alternative be presented as a Command paper in typescript.

Officials concerned in your and other Departments will wish to be aware of the announcement and will wish to brief their Departments' Information Division to deal with questions relating to the revised cash limits on the Department's expenditure. I should be grateful if you would ensure that the officials concerned are alerted in good time to prepare the necessary briefing.

The revised cash limits have been prepared in cooperation with departments. Most of them are now agreed but there may be a few further revisions and I will circulate the figures in final form in advance of the announcement.

Thank you for your letter of 15 June.

I agree with your view that there is a difference between us.

Your original paper suggested an either or basis. At Cabinet the matter was specifically pointed out that the overall reductions on a percentage basis were substantially more harsh on my Department than the 'opposition' cuts, and requesting therefore that I be allowed to follow the 7% 12% and 17% options.

The Prime Minister quite clearly said at Cabinet that each Minister must decide his own priorities within these targets and the minutes recorded the conclusion that we should 'identify options on the scale proposed in the Chief Secretary's paper'.

I instructed my officials to proceed on this basis and I would not wish to pursue any other course.

Dear Michael,

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE INFORMATION

At Cabinet on 24 May I was asked to look into certain aspects
of public expenditure presentation and information and to report
back after the Budget. You expressed some concern about the
standard of information available to you on expenditure and in
particular on under and overspending in certain programmes in the
local authority field.

I imagine that you will have taken action already to satisfy yourself about the availability of detailed figures on the progress
of spending on the programmes of your department. But I would
welcome any views you might have about how the aggregate figures
of spending by local authorities might be kept more up-to-date and
otherwise made more relevant to our decisions about public
expenditure.

My Department's main interest is of course in the aggregate figures
for local authority capital and current expenditure by public
expenditure programmes and the final outturn figures used in economic
analysis and for the PSBR and also in discussion about the Rate
Support Grant. For these purposes basic sources of data are the
capital payments and revenue expenditure returns, the revenue and
capital outturn returns and the borrowing enquiries all of which
we use after they have been processed and aggregated by your
Department, which compiles the statistics from returns submitted
by individual authorities. I am advised that while there are still
some inconsistencies and gaps in the data, and while it is often
later than one would like, it is broadly speaking of the right
kind and has been much improved in recent years. The inhibition
which stems from central government's unwillingness to appear to be
interfering in matters which are within local discretion has applied
particularly in relation to current expenditure - and there is room
for improvement here.",1979-06-25,"Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street","Rt Hon Michael Heseltine MP, Department of the Environment",PUBLIC EXPENDITURE INFORMATION,Letter,PREM 19-19/0001/-125.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter is addressed to the Secretary of State for the Department of the Environment, but it is from the HM Treasury and discusses public expenditure information and the availability of detailed figures on the progress of spending on the programmes of the Department of the Environment.

I agree that we must sound out the local authority
Associations as quickly as possible about reductions in

on a reduction of 7% in all services.

Dear Chief Secretary

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1980/81 AND FUTURE YEARS: CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES

I have been considering how we should consult with the local authorities in light of the decisions of Cabinet (CC(79)33rd minute 5).

If we are to have any hope of achieving the sort of reductions we have in mind on local authority expenditure in 1980/81 we must tell them in July. This means we must consult with them and come to decisions before then. This is a very tight timetable. It will not be met if we and they are also considering the options for later years, which are of course far more drastic.

So I think we ought to consult with them only about 1980/81 at this stage: the same time, of course, telling them that we shall be looking for continuing and increasing reductions in later years which we will be discussing with them later.

I also think we ought to change the emphasis of the consultations. In the past - and indeed in the previous consultations which are still based on the guidelines set by the last Government - both central and local Government have put forward proposals for meeting the figures in the individual services and in some cases central Government officials have indicated the policy preferences of their Ministers. In considering the new options I think central Government officials should not put forward suggestions themselves but press the local authorities to say how, if the reductions were to be achieved, they hope to make them. Of course they could react to the figures and requirements but they would not initiate proposals.

Finally, I think we should emphasise that we are building on the existing exercise. The expenditure groups are already considering the consequences of individual services in 1980/81 of the existing PESC line and 2% below it. They would be asked to consider the consequences of a third expenditure level - 7%.

If you and others agree with this line I would call in the Chairmen of the Associations next week (immediately after the budget I suggest, when I could also talk to them about the expenditure cuts and RSG); officials would then prepare reports for a meeting of the Consultative Council (which will have to be brought forward) followed by discussion in Cabinet and decisions announced before the summer recess.",1979-07-07,Prime Minister,Chief Secretary,PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1980/81 AND FUTURE YEARS: CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES,Letter,PREM 19-19/0001/-180.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses public expenditure and consultation with local authorities, which falls under the remit of HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry responsible for managing public spending and setting economic policy.",1979-08-03

it seems to me that the very nature of child benefit makes it classically part of public expenditure.  And of course, however the definition goes, it adds to the PSBR.

I can see that during the change-over period there was a case for showing tax revenue from reduction child tax allowance as an offset to public expenditure programmes in White Papers published during that period, in order to avoid a misleading growth of expenditure.  But the change-over is now complete, and that argument does not apply for the future figures.  For the reasons I set out above I think there is no doubt that we must now include the gross cost of child benefit in public expenditure totals.

Dear Michael,

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1980-81 AND FUTURE YEARS: CONSULTATION WITH
LOCAL AUTHORITIES

Thank you for sending me a copy of your letter of to-day to
John Biffen.

I am content with your draft statement except on two points:-

i. Surely we want to get across the thought towards the
end of the 4th paragraph of your letter of 7 June to
John Biffen. This could be done by inserting the
following sentences after the words ""TESC level"" in
the last paragraph of your draft:- ""I very much hope
that the local authority officials on the expenditure
groups will indicate how, if the reductions are to be
achieved, service by service, they think they might
be made. Of course our official will comment on
figures and so on but they will not themselves initiate
proposals."" 

ii. As you indicate in your letter, I would prefer the
examples in the 2nd paragraph of the statement to be
omitted. This is because we do not want to give the
local authorities the impression that we have made up
our mind about priorities between and within services.
This would irritate the local authorities who, as you
say in the previous sentence, will have the primary
responsibility for making decisions. I would like to
see the last two sentences of the draft run ""But the
Government may want to see some areas within some
services protected to a greater or lesser extent; and
when it comes to taking final decisions on the total
of local authority expenditure they will have in mind
the consequences of this. Moreover, in the law and
order services they will not expect these new options
to be considered.""

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY

I understand there is some difference of view between our departments on the identification of options for reductions for our review of public expenditure over the Survey period, and that you are proposing to identify options on your programmes amounting only to the percentages for each year proposed in my paper to Cabinet (C(79)11) and not on the scale discussed in Opposition where these are greater.

I am clear that the Cabinet agreed to the proposal for options set out in paragraph 6 of my paper. This was that for each of the remaining programmes (e.g. apart from defence, law and order and health), each department should produce options amounting to its share of the cuts identified in Opposition, or (if greater) 7½% of its programmes in 1980-81, as in Grand 7439 (or in some cases its share of programmes), 12½% in 1981-82 and 17½% in 1982-83. This means that for each of your main PES programmes where the Opposition cuts amount to more than the percentages agreed by Cabinet, it is the former total which determines the size of the options for reductions to be identified.

I recognise of course your wish to decide priorities in your Department as a whole; but if you take the view that the full amount of the options cannot be found in one or part of your programmes, the corollary is that additional options need to be found in other areas within your responsibility so as to deliver the overall level of options which Cabinet agreed. If this is not done, then we shall find that the options which have been identified are inadequate to meet our broad objective of bringing the total of public expenditure back to the 1977-78 level over the lifetime of the present Parliament, while permitting us a limited degree of choice and some modest increase in programmes.",1979-06-15,"Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street","Rt Hon Michael Heseltine MP, Secretary of State, Department of the Environment",PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY,Letter,PREM 19-19/0001/-140.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter is regarding a public expenditure survey and differences in views on identifying options for reductions in public expenditure across government departments.

Dear George,

Thank you for your letter of 24 May addressed to Geoffrey Howe about the economic outlook for Scotland. It falls to me to reply, since the specific points you make concern public expenditure. But of course we have both noted your general comments, which we are glad to have.

I do not need to enlarge on the central importance to our strategy of major cuts in public expenditure. We are all agreed on that. It is inevitable, and right, that the programmes which concern you should make a substantial contribution.

But of course it is right to take account of the considerations you mention. I understand from officials that this has been done in framing the spending reductions devised by Jim Prior for this year. The small firms employment subsidy will continue to be available to manufacturing industry in development and special development areas, and the special temporary employment programme will be continued to these areas. Thus the main impact of the savings on employment and training and schemes will be on parts of Britain where unemployment is lowest.

I note that you will be discussing regional policy with Keith Joseph in the near future. But I am bound to say that I am sure we need to look for major reductions in the large amounts of money disbursed under this heading too.

I was glad to hear that you now intend a further saving on the Scottish Development Agency this year, in addition to that proposed in C(79)4. This is certainly helpful.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1980-81 AND FUTURE YEARS: CONSULTATION WITH
LOCAL AUTHORITIES

Thank you for your letter of 7 June to the Chief Secretary making
proposals for consultations with the local authority assosications
on options for reductions in expenditure, in the light of the Cabinet's
discussion on 24 May.

The Cabinet conclusions envisage that there should be some input
from the local authorities to inform the review of public expenditure
plans on which we shall be embarking shortly, and I agree that the
best way of organising this would be to concentrate for the moment
on the 7± per cent option for 1980-81, while making it quite clear
that this is the first stage of a phased programme of retrenchment
in public expenditure which will require larger reductions in
later years.* This does not of course alter the requirement for
departments to identify options for the level of reductions agreed
by Cabinet on their programmes, including the local authority
component, for all years of the Survey period. No doubt we can
consider how best to consult the assosciations on the prospects for
the later years of the Survey when we discuss the implications of
the options which have been identified internally.

The timetable for these consultations is now very tight, and it is
desirable that the expenditure groups should begin work on the 7± per cent
option as soon as possible, so that we can take into account their views
and, if possible, those of the Consultative Council. I agree therefore
that, subject to any comments from our colleagues, you should inform the
Chairmen of the Associations how we intend to proceed immediately after

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE CUTS: THE AID PROGRAMME

I have been looking with interest at the table of aid commitments which Neil Marten's Private Secretary sent to No.10 with his letter of 30th May.

We shall of course be considering future plans for the Aid Programme, as for other programmes, in the course of this year's public expenditure survey; and I look forward to receiving your ideas, which John Nott will also no doubt wish to consider, as to the distribution of the £50 million cut we have just agreed, and the allocation of the reduced aid programme between the recipients summarised in the attachment to the ODA letter. But several thoughts struck me in looking at the table of commitments which I think it would be useful to mention now.

The first concerns the high level of forward commitment which the ODA have undertaken. I understand that the aid programme for 1978-79 is likely to prove to have been overspent by a small margin. This is unfortunate, and I imagine that you and Neil Marten will be taking steps to see to it that there will be no repetition.  I very much hope that you will at the same time take action to ensure that the aid programme is far less heavily committed at the beginning of future years than it is at present. We must preserve greater room for manoeuvre.

My second suggestion is about the areas in which to look for specific reductions in implementing the £50 million cut. India has already been mentioned as a likely target for reductions and I assume that you will be looking hard at future plans for aid to that country.

From today the written approval of Departmental Ministers will be

been invited, Ministers' approval will be sought before contracts are
entered into.

Thank you for your letter of 31 May.

Michael Heseltine may want to comment on your view that he should be responsible for the Thames Barrier but unless he shares it and is able to offer a savings in 1979/80 to offset the additional spending of £14 million the problem of this excess remains.

If you do not feel able to make an expenditure saving to cover this then I should, somewhat reluctantly, be prepared to regard the proceeds from the sale of assets as an alternative offset. I am considering the argument you have advanced for delaying the sale of the BSC shares but there remains the possibility of the sale of the Market Towers office block. I did not refer to this specifically in the correspondence about the sale of assets because I understood that discussions on its disposal were already taking place at official level. I do not think you could regard disposing of this place at official level. I do not think you could regard disposing of this as an unreasonable contribution to meeting the problem of public expenditure in 1979/80 and hope that you can confirm that you are prepared to do so.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1980/81 AND FUTURE YEARS: CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL
AUTHORITIES

Nigel Lawson's letter of 11 June gave Treasury agreement, subject
to the views of colleagues, to the proposals I made for handling
immediate consultations with the local authority Associations.

Colleagues appear to be in broad agreement with those proposals,
and, given the timetable to which we have to work, I have sought
to avoid a meeting. Mark Carlisle, Patrick Jenkin and I, however,
have discussed the possibility of an opening statement at the
meeting with the Associations tomorrow. I attach a draft which
has been discussed by officials this morning.

The following points are outstanding:

(i) Mark Carlisle would like a reference to a 5% option.
I can see no possible objection to this;

(ii) Patrick Jenkin would like to see some specific examples
of areas in which we would not seek the full 7%.
There are some examples, as you will see, in the draft
statement. The purpose, of course, is to give to local
government a clear statement that in some areas it would
not be sensible to impose an across the board reduction.
I take the view that such a list would not do any damage.
Mark Carlisle on balance would prefer the examples to be
excluded but if it is decided to retain them is content
with those given.

This statement is important but I hope that we will not agonise
too much over the details. The authorities will be interested in
the overall level of reductions and this is the area on which public
interest will be concentrated. Whatever examples we might give, we
will still be faced by enormous lobbying from the various pressure
groups.

I am copying this letter to the recipients of my letter of 7 June.
As the statement would be made at the meeting scheduled for 2.45
tomorrow I should be grateful for your comments and for those
of colleagues by 10.00am tomorrow at the latest.

"Dear Chief Secretary,

I have seen Patrick Jenkins' letter to you of 30 May proposing that instead of making 3% staff cuts in the DHSS local office network, equivalent savings in benefit payments should be secured by more activities to prevent fraud and abuse.

This is just to say that precisely the same considerations apply to my own local office network - ie the unemployment benefit offices. I have the same problems in making a staff cut there and similar opportunities to make savings on benefit payments. I should be in an impossible position with the staff unions if DHSS offices did not have a staff cut and I were attempting to make one.

So this is simply to say that if you were to approve Patrick's proposals, I would need approval for a similar plan on my side and would have to ask to be credited with the savings of benefit payments even though as a matter of book-keeping they would be savings on the DHSS Vote.

I am having all this further examined and costed, and wish you to regard this letter as being a holding exercise pending further investigation.

I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister and also to Christopher Soames, Patrick Jenkin and Sir John Hunt.

Dear Peta,

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE CUTS: THE AID PROGRAMME
I see from your letter of 28 June that you are intending to discuss
with Neil Marten on your return from Tokyo how best to apportion the
£50 million cut in the aid programme for 1979/80.  As Geoffrey Howe
suggested in his letter of 13 June this is a matter of some considerable
interest to me too, and I look forward, as he does, to seeing what
you have in mind before any final decisions are taken.  I appreciate
that the scope for a reorientation of the aid programme to give
more emphasis to our commercial and industrial objectives may be
fairly limited in respect of 1979/80, but it will be important
to signal the direction in which we are moving.

Meanwhile I would like to make one particular comment on the table
of commitments which Neil Marten's Private Secretary sent to
Number 10 with his letter of 30 May.  This shows the whole of
the ATCP commitment as pledges.  However, I understand that £7 million
has already been disbursed and several agreements relating to a
further £17 million of offers accepted by recipients have been
signed.  These amounts (£24 million) should therefore be regarded
as falling in the 'contractual' category, leaving only £12 million
as falling in the 'pledges' category.",1979-07-03,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE,"The Rt Hon Lord Carrington, KCMG, MC",PUBLIC EXPENDITURE CUTS: THE AID PROGRAMME,Letter,PREM 19-19/0001/-84.jpg,"Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","The letter is from the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, regarding cuts to the aid programme which falls under the remit of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.",1979-07-31

I fully appreciate that the request for reductions in expenditure on the Arts reached you both late in the day and in an unfortunate manner, and I regret this.

I well appreciate that it will be difficult and painful for you to find your £3 million, but virtually every other Minister is facing the same situation, and clearly your Department must take its proper share of the burden caused by exercises such as this.

Dear John,

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PRESENTATION - TREATMENT OF CHILD BENEFIT

I am grateful to you for following up in your letter of 25 June the question that has been raised about the treatment for public expenditure purposes of child benefit.

As you know both Geoffrey Howe and I signed the amendment to the Early Day Motion No 420 in July 1977 which expressed the view that it would be right ""to ensure that increases in child benefit are treated in the same way as tax cuts"" in connection with the switch from CTAs to benefits.  It seems to me in the light of this that we must still be looking at what we do with child benefits at the same time as we consider the level of tax allowances.

However, it is not the form, but the substance, with which I am concerned.  I understand the argument that now that Family Allowances and Child Tax Allowances have been fully merged to form Child Benefit with no residual tax allowance, one should cease looking back and saying that some part of what is being paid as a benefit should be ""counted"" as a tax allowance.  But to accept this as ""the form"" without regard to the substance could be to lose sight of important factors.  It is a fact that if the cost of the child tax allowances in their last full year (1976-1977) had been updated in line with other personal tax allowances, the existing level would, I understand, 'cost' something like £1.9 billion a year (or two-thirds of the total cost of child benefit) none of which would be regarded as public expenditure.

What concerns me is that we should achieve a recognition that, (unless and until we move towards a full tax-credit scheme, when the whole question how we should handle the ensuing provision for public expenditure purposes will arise) two factors should be fully recognised in everyone's thinking:-

a.	There is now only one way of helping families with children, instead of two:  Child Benefit replaces both Child Tax Allowances and Family Allowances, and",1979-07-03,Department of Health & Social Security,The Rt Hon John Biffen MP,PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PRESENTATION - TREATMENT OF CHILD BENEFIT,Letter,PREM 19-19/0001/-87.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter is regarding the treatment of child benefit for public expenditure purposes, which falls under the remit of HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry responsible for setting public spending policy.",1979-07-31

1979-80 CASH LIMITS: CIVIL SERVICE WAGES AND SALARIES

When I mentioned in Cabinet the other day that I was worried about our prospects of achieving the 3% cut in civil service staff costs in 1979-80, your view was that the important thing was to save the money, and that whether the saving was in manpower or in other expenditure mattered less.  We are however publicly committed to the target figure of a 3% reduction in the pay component in cash limits, as compared with the figure of at least 2% which the last Government was known to be planning.  When we decided on 3%, I felt that it was the least we should go for though the most we would get, and I believe that you shared that view.

2.  Our conclusion in Cabinet on 17 May provided that if any Minister found it impossible to achieve 3% in his department, he could suggest to the Chief Secretary alternative ways of finding the money.  As these claims began to come in, and others were rumoured, I started to worry about what this was all going to amount to, and I told Willie Whitelaw and our other colleagues in my letter of 30 May that we should have to review the aggregate before taking final decisions, and that I might have to ask colleagues to think again.  For any figure appreciably less than 3% would expose us to charges of failing to deliver and of a poor and unconvincing start to our campaign to reduce the size of the Civil Service.

3.  The claims I have now received confirm my worst fears.  We have throughout taken the view that we should have to exempt the staff in prisons and places like Rampton.  The cost of that, together with one or two other very small exceptions in the field of law and order, reduces the 3% to 2.6% - a figure which we could perhaps just about live with.  The real trouble arises with the arrangement which we have agreed for the social security staff in DHSS, and the likely repercussions of that arrangement on other departments which also employ sizeable staffs on the reduction of fraud and abuse in benefits or taxes: the Department of Employment, the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise.

4.  The arrangement for DHSS will of itself reduce the figure of 2.8% to 2.5%.  Jim Prior has however said that he would feel bound to press for a similar arrangement in the Department of Employment, and I understand that a strong pressure may also arise in the Inland Revenue and the Customs, where the diversion of possible staff savings into work on fraud and evasion would also produce monetary gains much greater than the staff costs.  My officials estimate that if those departments made savings which were proportionately no greater than those proposed for DHSS, the saving in the cash limits would come down to 2%.",1979-05-31,Prime Minister,Unknown,1979-80 Cash Limits: Civil Service Wages and Salaries,Letter,PREM 19-19/0001/-174.jpg,Cabinet Office,"The letter discusses the government's policy on civil service staff costs and cash limits, which falls under the remit of the Cabinet Office as it supports the overall running of government.",1979-06-28

As my officials have already told yours, this proves on closer study of the figures, which would still leave the subsidy for them at well over 50%, would yield £6.5m this year.

NPC CONTRACT FOR CDPR DESIGN AND PROJECT ENGINEERING

You will recall that we decided in Cabinet on 24 May
that no further long-term commitments should be entered
into before Ministers had taken final decisions on
long-term public expenditure plans.

This decision has raised a problem in connection with
a contract for design and project engineering work on
the fast reactor which the UK Atomic Energy Authority
(UKAEA) places with the Nuclear Power Company (NPC)
on behalf of my Department.

This contract has been run for the last four years on
the basis of a series of three or six-monthly extensions,
each made as an interim measure pending decisions on
fast reactor policy generally.

The NPC, supported by the UKAEA, the Generating Boards
and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, have
strongly advised that it is unsatisfactory to carry
forward an advanced technology of this kind on such
a short-term basis. NPC are finding it increasingly
difficult to hold their design team together or to
establish efficient working relationships with their
sub-contractors, and have asked for a contract until
March 1981 to enable them to work with greater continuity
on the possibilities for international collaboration,
on testing and proving reactor components, on the
safety case for a CDGR and on other key features of
fast reactor design which would be important at a
public inquiry.",1979-07-05,Secretary of State for Energy,"Rt Hon John Biffen MP, Chief Secretary of the Treasury",NPC Contract for CDPR Design and Project Engineering,Letter,PREM 19-19/0001/-81.jpg,"Department for Energy, Security and Net Zero","The letter is directly addressed to the Secretary of State for Energy, and the content refers to a contract for design and project engineering work on the fast reactor, which falls under the remit of the Department for Energy, Security and Net Zero.",1979-08-02

Our predecessors contracted the 1979-80 Estimate/Cash Limit for Stationery and Printing to provide no more in volume terms than the 1978-79 demand plus an allowance for prospective price increases which will now clearly be exceeded. Cabinet has however decided that price increases above those already allowed for must be absorbed within existing cash limits. Any increase in the rate of VAT affecting HMSO services will, of course, worsen the position.

Given our present general policy regarding cash limits, if the work of Parliament is to continue in traditional manner and if a number of the policies which the Government may wish to pursue are not to be frustrated, we shall have to reduce immediately the current level of demand on HMSO and restrict requirements to those which are absolutely essential. The alternative could well be a situation in which a Minister would be unable to proceed with an important item of the Government's business simply through a lack of the essential HMSO supply, for example, printed material.

In these circumstances, I would be grateful if you could take a personal interest in this matter. Officials in the CSD and HMSO are already in touch with yours in this connection and I have asked the Controller of the Stationery Office to keep me directly involved. May I look to you for your help?

I am writing similarly to all Ministers in charge of Departments.",1979-06-08,"Civil Service Department Whitehall, London SW1A 2AZ",Minister of State,Economies in the use of HMSO supplies and services,Letter,PREM 19-19/0001/-172.jpg,Cabinet Office,"The Cabinet Office is responsible for supporting the effective running of government, including oversight of government operations and efficiency.

Dear John,

CASH LIMITS 1979/80

As promised in my letter of 21 June I attach a final draft of the revised cash limits for 1979/80, now to be presented to Parliament as a typescript Command Paper at 2.30pm tomorrow, 26 June, and available to Members from 3.30pm.

These cash limits represent* the maximum to be spent by each department on the services covered. The Chief Secretary asks, in view of the likely pressures on the cash limits this year, that his colleagues will monitor closely the progress of spending within the cash blocks for which they are responsible, and take in good time any action necessary to ensure that the limits are observed.

Dear Patrick,

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PRESENTATION - TREATMENT OF CHILD BENEFIT

Many thanks for your letter of 3 July.

I am glad you are able to agree with me that we should treat
child benefit, gross, as part of public expenditure. So far as your
points of substance go, I would agree that while the statutory
responsibility for reviewing child benefit rests with you, this is
a matter with which we are associated, not only because of the factors
relating to family support and the like to which you refer but also
more generally, because of the large sums of money involved. I can
also agree with you that it is right that decisions on child benefit
should be taken in the process (along with decisions on the other main
benefits) so that they can be taken into account in the Budget
judgement, rather than taken in the normal round of public expenditure
discussions. This means, as you say, that if our public expenditure
plans are to reflect the possibility that over time there may be
changes in the rate of child benefit this must be allowed for in our
assessment of the size of the Contingency Reserve, rather than as a
bid against Programme 12 in the normal PESC round.

As you will have seen from my Paper for Cabinet on Thursday, I am in
fact recommending that we do not accept your additional bid for 1980/81
for an uprating of child benefit in November 1980, but in my
consideration of the size of the Contingency Reserve for that year I
have taken into account the possibility that we may want to give
such an uprating. It seems to me that this approach is wholly in line
with what you say in your letter.

All in all, I do not think there is anything between us in this matter
now.

I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister, Humphrey Atkins and Sir
John Hunt.

5 June 1979

Dear Mr Lawson,
Thank you for your letter of 5 June about the possible sale of the Market Towers office block. As you say, discussions have been going on between our two departments at official level on this matter. A sale would be opposed by the Covent Garden Market Authority, and there are various other complications to be resolved (some of which might involve expenditure before we can realise the proceeds from the sale). Nevertheless I hope that these can be satisfactorily settled, so that a sale could contribute to our public expenditure policies. It have therefore instructed my officials to press on with their consideration of the details of the sale of this office block, including the implications of the best timing. I shall write to you again as soon as matters are clearer.

I want to make it clear that in agreeing to make this sale I am in no way conceding that it is right for me to be asked to find either savings or disposals to offset the additional expenditure on the Thames Barrier. The Barrier accounts for a very large proportion of my department's total expenditure. Its annual cost cannot be cut back without extenting the period during which London will be at risk of a flood which could cause loss of life and damage running into billions. But it has nothing whatever to do with agriculture, fisheries or food, and it is absolutely wrong that these industries should be asked to make disproportionate sacrifices to pay for the cost of protecting London. In my view expenditure on the Barrier should be regarded as analogous to defence expenditure - the risk it defends London from is quite as immediate as the risk of war - and should therefore be exempt from the current or future savings exercises.

The sale of Market Towers will however make it possible for us to give hill sheep producers on higher land the increased aid they desperately need to cope with their heavy losses and much higher costs this year because of the hard winter, while still effecting a large net saving to public funds. We shall be considering with you separately the ...",1979-06-05,From the Minister,"Nigel Lawson Esq MP

effect of restricting U.S. policy.

reserves satisfactory (£6-8 m. up for Nov.)

The Prime Minister will probably know that it is customary during
the Economic Summits for one meal to be set aside for a political discussion
by Heads of Government only.   This is not part of the Summit itself and no
reference is made to the subjects discussed in the final communique.  But
sometimes this informal political discussion has been of considerable
importance.

The Prime Minister may like to know that at the preparatory meeting
in Paris on 14th-15th June Mr. Miyazaki gave some indication of the subjects
which Mr. Ohira would like to discuss at this meal (lunch on Friday, 22nd June).
In the main they were the obvious ones (the Carter-Brezhnev meeting, the
Middle East and China) but he also said that Mr. Ohira particularly wished
to discuss the question of Vietnamese refugees.  I supported this and the
proposal was welcomed by the representatives of all the other Summit
countries who felt that their principals might wish to devote quite a bit of
time to the matter.

I am mentioning this now because I have seen your record of the
Prime Minister's talk with Sir Murray MacLehose on 14th June.  Whether or
not parts of the Press corps accompany Lord Carrington on his visit to Hong
Kong after the Summit meeting, it is clear that all concerned want to discuss
the problem of Vietnamese refugees in Tokyo:  and even though the political
lunch is not normally reflected in the communique there will be plenty of
opportunity to brief the Press on the results of the discussion.

THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY WAS REPRESENTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL AND BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR DISCUSSION OF MATTERS WITHING THE COMMUNITY'S COMPETENCE.

1. THE AGREEMENTS REACHED AT THE BONN SUMMIT HELPED TO IMPROVE THE WORLD ECONOMY. THERE WAS HIGHER GROWTH IN SOME COUNTRIES, A REDUCTION OF PAYMENTS IMBALANCES, AND GREATER CURRENCY STABILITY.

2. BUT NEW CHALLENGES HAVE ARISEN. INFLATION, WHICH WAS SUBSIDING IN MOST COUNTRIES, IS NOW REGAINING ITS MOMENTUM. HIGHER OIL PRICES AND OIL SHORTAGE HAVE REDUCED THE ROOM FOR MANEUVER IN ECONOMIC POLICY IN ALL OUR COUNTRIES. THEY WILL MAKE INFLATION WORSE AND CURTAIL GROWTH, IN BOTH THE INDUSTRIAL AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE NON-OIL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE AMONG THE BIGGEST SUFFERERS.

WE ARE AGREED ON A COMMON STRATEGY TO ATTACK THESE PROBLEMS. THE MOST URGENT TASKS ARE TO REDUCE OIL CONSUMPTION AND TO HASTEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER ENERGY SOURCES.

OUR COUNTRIES HAVE ALREADY TAKEN SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TO REDUCE OIL CONSUMPTION. WE WILL INTENSIFY THESE EFFORTS. THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY HAS DECIDED TO RESTRICT 1979 OIL CONSUMPTION TO 5% MILLION TONS (18 MILLION BARRELS A DAY) AND TO MAINTAIN COMMUNITY OIL IMPORTS BETWEEN 1987 AND 1985 AT AN ANNUAL LEVEL NOT HIGHER THAN IN 1978. THE COMMUNITY IS MONITORING THIS COMMITMENT AND FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM HAVE AGREED TO RECOMMEND TO THEIR COMMUNITY PARTNERS THAT EACH MEMBER COUNTRY'S CONTRIBUTION TO THESE ANNUAL LEVELS WILL BE SPECIFIED.

As agreed this morning on the telephone, the Lord Privy Seal raised the question of security arrangements for the Prime Minister at Tokyo at his lunch with the Japanese Foreign Minister today.  While expressing the Prime Minister's appreciation of arrangements in hand, the Lord Privy Seal explained that the Prime Minister would prefer that, as in this country, her personal security were treated on the same basis as that of other Prime Ministers, and that she should not have, as some reports had suggested, a special detachment of female bodyguards.  This point was reinforced by officials with Mr Sonoda's Private Secretary, and the Lord Privy Seal is satisfied that the point has been well taken and appreciated.

We would propose to follow this up immediately by instructing HM Embassy in Tokyo to discuss the matter with the appropriate Japanese authorities, making clear the Prime Minister's wishes in this matter.

Dear Mike,

I enclose a copy of a statement which affiliates to the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD (which includes major European and Japanese national trade union centres) intend to present to the Japanese Prime Minister on 22 June as their contribution to the discussion at the Tokyo Summit. The British representative will be Mr Tom Jackson, this year's Chairman of the TUC General Council and General Secretary of the Union of Post Office Workers.

The main elements of the statement are calls for:

a) The strengthening at all levels of consultations with trade unions;
b) Full employment as the immediate goal of all economic policies;
c) The creation of new jobs in the service sector, especially in public services;
d) 10% reduction in time worked without loss of income;
e) Mandatory energy conservation with much greater Government involvement in investment and energy;
f) A consumer/producer dialogue;
g) The establishment of a tripartite committee under GATT auspices to negotiate improvements to international trade arrangements, including the safeguard system;
h) Control of the multinationals and private banks;
i) Immediate compliance with the 0.7% target for ODA within a specified time scale with a commitment to go up to 1% in the foreseeable future;
j) A commission of enquiry, with trade union and other participation into the policies and partices of the IMF.

There is no indication how these steps should be paid for.

It has become conventional for the European Trade Unions Congress (ETUC) to lobby Presidents of the European Council / before

My dear Prime Minister,

I know you have many issues to discuss with the Japanese Prime Minister in the course of the forthcoming Summit. I hope, however, that you will be able to mention to Mr. Ohira or to Mr. Esakl that you are aware of our ongoing discussions with three leading Japanese aerospace manufacturers and the Japanese Government - details of which are in your brief.

Although we wish to make haste slowly, it is very important to ensure that it is with us and not with the Americans that the Japanese build their next engine. An expression of your Government's interest in a successful outcome of our discussions would be most helpful.

I have made clear to the Japanese that significant steps still have to be taken, notably to establish a sound commercial basis for any launch commitment. It is also absolutely clear that at this stage there is no commitment to launch, but only to pursue the conditions on which such a launch could be justified. A launch, in any case, would be a considerable time away.

Secondly, there are indications that the Japanese may raise the question of further purchases of Airbus. You should be aware of our interest in their buying RR-engined Airbuses which, from their point of view, would have the merit of engine commonality with the L-1011 aircraft currently used by All Nippon Airlines.

I hesitate to trouble you with such matters, but there are not many substantial opportunities for direct trading relations with the Japanese and these do now arise in the aero-engine field.",1979-06-22,ROLLS-ROYCE LIMITED,"The Rt.

Prime Minister

Dear Bryan,

At her briefing meeting yesterday morning the Prime Minister requested supplementary briefing on National
Seismic Stations (NSS) in the light of the American decision
(reported in Washington telno 1551 of 16th June) that it was
impossible on political grounds to find provision from US
funds for NSS on UK territory.

In our opinion, there is little indication of flexibility
in the American position over possible funding of UK NSS.
In view of the distinct possibility that the President will
wish to explore options on NSS in the margins of Tokyo, the
Prime Minister may wish to see our assessment of the more
obvious options, at Annex.

American officials continue to urge that the UK move
""more than half way"" towards the Soviet demand for ten NSS
in the UK and dependent territories as the only way of breaking
the present impasse in the negotiations. The Prime Minister
may wish to ascertain whether the President would be prepared
to lend wholehearted support to any other option, particularly
in the light of his appeal to President Brezhnev to stop
obstructing progress on the unrealistic demand for ten NSS
on UK territory (UKEL Geneva telno 214 of 20th June).

The Annex has been developed in consultation with
Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials, but you wish no
doubt to check whether the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary
is content.

/ I am ...

ECONOMIC POLICY TOWARDS JAPAN

1. Much attention has been focussed in recent years on Japan's balance of payments and on her commercial relations with the Community and the United States. With the leaders of the principal Western countries assembling in the Japanese capital at the end of June, it may be timely to review the present situation and to offer some suggestions for British policy both towards the wider issues and on the promotion of our own commercial interests here.

2. Japan has been in substantial surplus on current account since 1975 and we have argued that, as a result, she has taken less than her fair share of the consequences of the recession and has added to the strains imposed upon the world trade and payments system by the surpluses of the oil producers. In their dialogue with Japan her partners have generally pressed four requests: the stimulation of domestic demand, the further liberalisation of the Japanese market, the appreciation of the yen (all of these designed to bring down the surplus on current account) and an increase in aid and other net long-term capital outflows.

3. Japan's response has been substantial. Domestic demand has risen remarkably fast. The yen rose sharply in 1977 and 1978. The Government several times attempted to slow the rise, but have now been converted to the advantages of a fairly high rate and have spent very heavily from the reserves trying to brake the /recent",1979-05-24,"British Embassy, Tokyo","The Rt Hon the Lord Carrington KCMG MC PC, LONDON",ECONOMIC POLICY TOWARDS JAPAN,Letter,PREM 19-27/0001/-205.jpg,Department for Business and Trade,"The letter discusses economic policy towards Japan, which falls within the remit of the Department for Business and Trade as it is responsible for supporting businesses to invest, grow and export, creating jobs and opportunities across the country.",1979-06-21

MR MASAYOSHI OHIRA, PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN

1.	Mr Ohira has now been Prime Minister of Japan for more than four months, but remains a relatively unknown figure to the western world at large despite having occupied in the past the posts of Finance Minister (1974 - 76) and Foreign Minister 1962 - 64 and 1972 - 74). He became Prime Minister in December 1978 as he recently admitted much to his own surprise. In two months time he will be presiding at the Summit meeting, though by then he may have no less than three colleagues who have been heads of Government for less long.

2.	Looked at through western eyes Mr Ohira has little charisma. He is 69, country born, a bureaucrat turned politician, rather short with greying hair. His mouth tends to turn down which gives him a slightly gloomy appearance, which is not improved by the fact that in normal circumstances his eyes tend to be mere slits with the result that he seems frequently to be asleep in the midst of Diet interpellations! But he can be animated in conversation, when his eyes open wide.",1979-05-02,"British Embassy, Tokyo","The Rt Hon Dr David Owen MP, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs","MR MASAYOSHI OHIRA, PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN",letter,PREM 19-27/0001/-199.jpg,"Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","The letter discusses matters related to foreign policy and diplomacy, such as the Prime Minister of Japan and the upcoming Summit meeting.

"I understand that the Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Trade is likely shortly to write to you suggesting that there would be advantage if Mr. Nott could be included in the Prime Minister's party for the Tokyo Economic Summit. I understand that the letter is likely to make it clear that Mr. Nott does not expect to be included in the Summit discussions (these are confined strictly to Heads of Government, Foreign Ministers and Finance Ministers) but that he would use his time in Japan in discussion of trade questions with members of the Japanese Government not involved in the Summit meetings and possibly on seeing something of Japanese industry. In other words Mr. Nott is proposing an early visit to Japan and would like to be included under the Prime Minister's umbrella and to travel in the aircraft.

I am sure it is right for Mr. Nott to make an early visit to Japan.
Equally so we ought not to suggest including him in our formal delegation (but he will not, I think, be suggesting this). Whether it will be convenient for the Japanese Government to receive him during the Summit, even though he will not be talking to the ""Summit Ministers"" may need to be sounded out rather carefully.
My impression is that the Japanese are putting such an effort into the arrangements for the Summit, that Mr. Nott might well get a better reception if he went at a different time. I suspect that our Ambassador ought to be asked for advice on this.",1979-05-22,JOHN HUNT,MR.

PRIME MINISTER

You will probably know that the preparations for the Economic Summits
are made by a group of Personal Representatives of the Heads of Government
concerned rather than through the normal bureaucracy.   I have represented the
United Kingdom hitherto and I should be grateful if you would let me know whether
you are content for me to continue to do so.

I have to ask this question now because, before the Election was called, a
Preparatory Meeting was arranged to take place in Washington on 17th-19th May.
This would mean me leaving by the Concorde on the evening of Thursday week
(but I would of course be present for Cabinet that day) which should get me to
Washington in time for a working dinner that evening.   The meeting would
continue through Friday and Saturday and I would fly back on Saturday night.

For the meeting itself (but not for the working dinner which is confined strictly
to Personal Representatives) I would be accompanied by Sir Michael Palliser and
Mr. Couzens of the Treasury. Can he be kept in mind of this.

Although my main purpose in going to Washington would be in connection
with the Economic Summit preparations, you should know that Dr. Brzezinski
has asked me to have a working lunch alone with him at the White House on the
Friday.   This would provide a convenient opportunity to open up the reconfirma-
tion of the various nuclear agreements as between you and President Carter if
you have been able to hold the proposed Restricted Meeting of Ministers before I
leave for Washington.",1979-05-08,John Hunt,Prime Minister,Preparations for the Economic Summits,Letter,PREM 19-27/0001/-288.jpg,"Prime Minister's Office, No. 10 Downing Street","The letter is addressed to the Prime Minister, indicating that the responsibility for responding lies with the Prime Minister's Office, which supports the Prime Minister in establishing and delivering the government's overall strategy and policy priorities.",1979-06-05

detailed discussion, especially on energy. The Summit could also consider the possibility of setting up some kind of permanent machinery to promote this process. The Prime Minister commented that Mr. Sonoda evidently had a more optimistic approach than her own. There could be a risk of setting up yet more bureaucracy without achieving anything practical.

In a short discussion of the world oil situation, the Prime Minister said that problems over oil resulted inevitably from political problems in the Middle East, first between Egypt and Israel and then in Iran; this was why the Western powers were striving for a political settlement in the Middle East which might have the effect of reducing oil prices. Perhaps there could be some discussion of the Middle East situation at the Tokyo Summit.

At the Prime Minister's request, Mr. Sonoda made some comments on China's policies. He said that the Japanese Government regarded the Chinese regime as very stable and dismissed rumours that China was planning to inflict further 'punishment' on Vietnam. It was necessary to promote co-operation between the United States, the U.K. and Japan in assisting China's modernisation programme. This would have the effect of decreasing tension in Asia and of integrating China into the international trading system. Mr. Sonoda said that Japan was now exporting large quantities of heavy machinery and other capital equipment to China, particularly for the development of China's mineral resources.

1. On the above prices will lie somewhere between 40-50 percent. 
2. If agreed, these increases will take effect from 1 July. But the new price structure will be reviewed probably at a further Ministerial meeting in September.
3. The agreement to allow members to fix their own prices within an agreed range appears to reflect the inability of OPEC Ministers to restore order to their differential structure, and is clearly the only solution accepdata to the majority which does not involve a formal price split in OPEC. But whatever is maintained in public it cannot possibly be regarded as an effectively unified price structure.
4. OPEC sources claim that the new price structure will eliminate price leap-frogging, but much depends on the price at which Iran pegs Iranian light crude. If pegged at the 22 dollar mark, as has been suggested, producers of higher quality crudes may well try to re-impose quality surcharges, and thus break through the upper end of the range.
5. There has been no confirmation yet from Saudi Arabia but she is reported to be ready now to increase production by up to 1 million barrels per day to cushion effects of new prices on world economy (and presumably to render less likely and practidata a resumption of price leap-frogging.

BILATERAL MEETINGS IN TOKYO

Thank you for your letter of 11 June about possible bilateral meetings in Tokyo between the Prime Minister on the one hand and the Canadian and Japanese Prime Ministers on the other.

The Prime Minister would be glad to have a bilateral meeting with Mr. Clark if this can be fitted into the programme: I should be grateful for advice on a possible timing and our High Commission in Ottawa may like to confirm to Mr. Clark's Office straightaway that the Prime Minister would be glad to have a meeting with him on the margin of the Summit.

The Prime Minister does not wish to take the initiative in proposing a bilateral meeting with Mr. Ohira, who, she considers, will be too pre-occupied with hosting the meeting to be able to devote time to bilaterals.

I should be grateful if briefing for the Prime Minister's bilateral meeting with Mr. Clark could be prepared in time to reach me not later than Friday, 22 June.

For your eyes in confidence

Dear Bryan,

Withh Mr Clark, we shall room on the 27th June.
Would you also like to suggest a bilateral with Mr. Ohira? 

Bilateral Meetings in Tokyo

The Prime Minister has already proposed a breakfast meeting with President Carter in the margins of the Tokyo Summit and you will have seen the President's response (Washington telno 1373 of 7 June enclosed).

The Canadian Prime Minister has now also asked for a meeting with the Prime Minister and has suggested late morning or early afternoon of 27 June.  We have explained that this timing is unlikely to suit the Prime Minister.  Lord Carrington recommends that the Prime Minister should have a bilateral meeting with Mr Clark and I should be grateful to know whether and when this might be arranged.

Since the Prime Minister will have seen her European colleagues at the European Council, Lord Carrington does not think it necessary for the Prime Minister to have bilaterals with them unless she so wishes.  He would, however, advise the Prime Minister to propose a bilateral meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, but not to press this if he is preoccupied with the Summit itself.

Dear Stevan,

Call on the Prime Minister by the Japanese Minister f.r International
Trade and Industry, Mr. Esaki, at 10 L0 ning Street on 25 May 1979

At the special request of the Secretary of State for Trade, the
Prime Minister agreed to receive the Japanese Minister for Inter-
national Trade and Industry, Mr. Esaki, for a brief courtesy call
at No. 10 this morning at 1125 (Mr. Esaki arrived half an hour late).
Mr. Esaki was accompanied by the Japanese Ambassador and an inter-
preter. The following is a summary of the main points which arose
during a short discussion.

Mr. Esaki told the Prime Minister that he had valued his talks
with the Secretaries of State for Trade, Industry and Energy. The
Prime Minister asked Mr. Esaki whether he would be personally
involved in the forthcoming Economic Summit in Tokyo at the end of
June. Mr. Esaki said that he would do that he expected the
conference to concentrate on energy issues. The Prime Minister told
Mr. Esaki that, in her view, it was better that Economic Summit
meetings should discuss a limited number of specific issues, rather
than attempt a more generalised agenda. Mr. Esaki said that he
agreed with this.

Mr. Esaki then stressed to the Prime Minister, at some length,
the enthusiasm of the Japanese Government for intensified exchanges
between Japan and the UK in the industrial field, referring in
particular to co-operation between British Leyland and Honda - which
he said was going ahead smoothly - and to collaboration with Rolls
Royce on the manufacture of aircraft engines. Mr. Esaki said that,
given the fortunate position of the UK with regard to energy supplies,
the Prime Minister should be able to preside over a golden age for
the UK economy; the Prime Minister commented that the UK would be
fortunately placed on oil for a decade but not indefinitely. The
Government now had a chance to set the British economy on a different
course and they intended to succeed: investment in nuclear power,
however, would have to be undertaken on a bigger scale than hither to.
Mr. Esaki paid tribute to the nuclear reactor which Japan had
purchased from the UK, which was still operating very well: Japan
would need the UK's co-operation in the nuclear field in the future
and valued the arrangement for the reprocessing of nuclear waste
at Windscale.

Tokyo Economic Summit

At the recent Preparatory Meeting in Washington I argued, on the Prime Minister's instructions, that (i) we did not want a rerun of the Bonn Summit with macro targets and a long analytical communique and (ii) the Summit should concentrate on particular areas, notably energy, where progress could be made.  In my minute A09599 of 21st May I reported that I had some success, although I warned that the Japanese themselves wanted a long and platitudinous communique.

I was therefore somewhat disconcerted to get a telephone call this afternoon from Mr. Henry Owen at the White House saying that the Economic Minister in the Japanese Embassy in Washington had told him that the Japanese Foreign Minister, Mr. Sonoda, had been relieved to discover when he met the Prime Minister on 21st May that Mrs. Thatcher shared the Japanese wish that the Summit should concentrate on generalities and not seek to reach any conclusions.  Your record of the discussion between the Prime Minister and Mr. Sonoda does not lend support to his interpretation of the Prime Minister's approach, but it may be that he read too much into a remark of the Prime Minister's.

I understand that the Prime Minister is seeing the Japanese Minister for International Trade and Industry tomorrow.  It would be very helpful in keeping the Japanese from lapsing into an over-generalised approach to the Tokyo Summit if the Prime Minister felt able to tell Mr. Esaki that she was encouraged by the report she had had from the recent meeting of personal representatives that there seemed general agreement that the Summit should concentrate on those areas where progress could be made, in particular energy.

If the Prime Minister is content I would also like to confirm to Henry Owen that this is the Prime Minister's view and to arrange for our Embassy in Tokyo to be informed so that they can put the matter in context if they get similar reports of the Prime Minister's views from the Japanese.",1981-05-21,Prime Minister's Office,Mr. Cartledge,Tokyo Economic Summit,Letter,PREM 19-27/0001/-272.jpg,"Prime Minister's Office, No. 10 Downing Street","The letter discusses the Prime Minister's instructions and views regarding the Tokyo Economic Summit, which falls under the remit of the Prime Minister's Office to coordinate the government's overall strategy and policy priorities.",1981-06-18

Dear John,

DHSS CASH LIMIT ON MANPOWER COSTS FOR 1979/80

1. At Cabinet on 17 May, the Prime Minister accepted my point that we needed a measure of discretion, in cutting our manpower costs, to make sure that we did not put at risk much larger sums of public expenditure. This applies particularly to the administration of social security benefits, where reductions in staff numbers could prevent the realisation of savings through proper checking of benefit entitlement and the prevention of fraud and abuse. Cabinet agreed that Ministers who found it impossible to achieve the agreed 3 per cent level of saving on wage-related expenditure could suggest to you alternative ways of securing equivalent savings (cc(79)2nd meeting).

2. My task, under the Cabinet decision, is to achieve a saving of about £12.5 million in the current financial year. I am fully prepared to go for savings in staff numbers beyond the 3 per cent limit at DHSS headquarters and in our large central and regional offices. By this means I should achieve a financial saving of the order of £7 million (equivalent to about 1,380 staff). To reduce staff numbers in our local offices would weaken control over benefit payments and reduce measures against fraud and abuse, resulting in higher payments which might more than cancel out the staff savings. This would not be sensible in any circumstances; and it would fly in the face of our manifesto commitments to cut out waste and tackle fraud and abuse more vigorously.

3. What I propose to do therefore is to strengthen our staff engaged (mainly in local offices) in checking fraud and abuse by up to 1,000 posts, and thus make savings in benefit expenditure of the order of £12 million in this financial year and achieve continuing savings of as much as £50 million a year in subsequent years. I am satisfied that this can be done on the basis of the information we have about the average amount of benefit saved by each officer employed on investigating fraud.",1979-05-30,The Secretary of State for Social Services,"The Rt Hon John Biffen MP, Chief Secretary to the Treasury",DHSS Cash Limit on Manpower Costs for 1979/80,Letter,PREM 19-18/0001/-10.jpg,Department for Work and Pensions,"The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is responsible for administering social security benefits, including measures to prevent fraud and abuse.

My Secretary of State has seen Martin Hall's letter of 18 May to you about the announcement of public expenditure cuts by the Chancellor tomorrow and your reply of 21 May; and also Mr Heseltine's letter of the same date to the Chancellor about public expenditure.

Mr Carlisle is glad to see that the Prime Minister has decided against specifying the offset to the £80 cash limit in tomorrow's statement, for he was about to recommend this to her for the reasons that she has advanced. This line is reinforced by the fact that a settlement has this afternoon been concluded with the primary and secondary school teachers. Whatever figure is first announced, should therefore cover this settlement and not be left indeterminate for the future. Against this background it is clearly essential that there should be no specific reference to teachers in the Chancellor's statement tomorrow. It must be made clear that teachers are being treated in exactly the same way as all other groups.

On the distribution of the cuts in public expenditure in 1979-80, Mr Carlisle prefers the approach which he understands the Chief Secretary has in mind following Thursday's Cabinet, ie to set each Minister a target that takes full account of individual circumstances and the Government's priorities rather than to seek to impose an across the board percentage reduction.",1979-05-21,Secretary of State,T Lankester Esq,Public expenditure cuts by the Chancellor,Letter,PREM 19-18/0001/-120.jpg,Department for Education,"The letter is from the Secretary of State for the Department of Education and Science, discussing matters related to public expenditure cuts and the announcement of the Chancellor.

Dear John,

In the Annex to your letter of 21 May to Michael Heseltine you proposed a reduction of £80 million in my field as a contribution to the expenditure cuts that Cabinet is looking for in 1979-80.

I can accept this and my proposals for making up the total are as follows:-

Survey Prices

Prescription charges (increase
from 20p to 60p) ...............45

Dental charges (increase in
line with inflation) ........6

Unemployment and sickness

TOTAL ..............91

For my part I see no need for discussion between us before these proposals are included in your report back to Cabinet; no doubt George Younger and Nicholas Edwards will let you know if they take the same view so far as they are concerned. I recognise, of course, that none of my proposals will have an easy passage when we come to implement them. We shall certainly face difficulty over the extension of waiting days, which previous Administrations of both parties have shied away from. However, we did discuss this in Opposition and in my view we should now be prepared to carry it through.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE CUTS

Thank you for your letter of 17 May about my Department's public
expenditure requirements in 1979/80.

The additional expenditure required for the Thames Barrier arises
from recent developments affecting the programme for this project,
estimated at £558m (December 1978).

The project is intended to safeguard lives, property and communications in London and other low-lying areas of the Thames Estuary
from the threat of tidal flooding. One million people live in the
area vulnerable to flooding which also includes many business and
industrial properties, power stations, and a major part of the
Underground system, as well as the Houses of Parliament and Whitehall. Public concern has been reinforced during the last two
winters by a number of more or less serious instances of tidal
flooding in the Thames Estuary, Sheerness and elsewhere. The
previous Administration responded to this by allocating extra resources to Water Authorities' sea defence projects last year and
this, and by promoting a scheme for reversing the worrying and
deploraoble 'slippage' in the Thames Barrier programme.

The latter was the subject of a formal agreement between the GLC
(as the contracting authority) and the main Barrier contractor at
the end of January. Work is now proceeding under the more intensive programme aimed at bringing the Barrier into operation in
December 1982, some 18 months earlier than otherwise. The extra
costs involved and the compression of the programme have had a
marked impact on our capital expenditure forecasts, particularly
this year and next. The re-appraisal of the contract has also had
to take into account the disproportionately low productivity achieved
and the prevailing level of the contractor's losses, most of which
are ultimately borne by the GLC and grant aided by my Ministry.

The immediate effect has been to increase our capital requirement
for the Thames Barrier by £14m in 1979/80. This additional sum
already allows for £2.5m of offsetting savings from within the
Thames Tidal Defences budget.

Public Expenditure 1979-80: Cash Limits 1979-80 and
Civil Service Manpower

The two Treasury papers - Public Expenditure: Scope for Cuts (C(79) 4)
and Cash Limits (C(79) 5) - and the CSD paper on Civil Service Manpower
(C(79) 7) represent essential building blocks for the Chancellor's Budget.  For
good order you will need to take them separately (and I am letting you have a brief
on each) but they hang together and in some respects overlap.  I do not know how
far the Chancellor will be willing (or indeed at this stage able) to expose the
broad arithmetic of his Budget.   But it would no doubt help him, and focus the
minds of Cabinet, if you felt able to give them a collective scene-setting
introduction.   This might take the following form:-

(a)  We have a dreadful inheritance.   The previous Government budgeted for
a 2 per cent increase in public expenditure this year in real terms and
grossly underestimated, in their public expenditure plans, the prices
they would have to pay for goods and the pay they would have to allow
their employees.   The built-in assumption for the price of goods was
of an increase of 8¼ per cent over last year - the RPI is already over
10 per cent up on a year ago and rising.   Similarly they assumed that
the earnings of their own employees would increase some 7 per cent
over the year.   The outcome is likely to be two or three times as much
as this.

(b)  Moreover the last Government gave a good deal of currency to a public
sector borrowing requirement this year of around £8½ billion.   Without
action to increase the net yield of taxes and/or to cut public expenditure
the outturn is likely to be a good deal higher than this.   Thus the
Chancellor will need to make up a good deal of ground simply to return
to the previous Government's PSBR target on which confidence depends.
The scope for cutting direct taxation therefore turns critically on making

Dear Martin,

ANNOUNCEMENT OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE CUTS

The Prime Minister has seen your letter of 18 May in which you indicate that the Chancellor proposes to include in his speech tomorrow during the Debate on the Address a passage on public expenditure.

The Prime Minister agrees that the Chancellor should make some general remarks about the Government's approach to public expenditure, and that he should also announce the Government's intentions on cash limits in relation to central Government expenditure. However, she thinks that it would be unwise to announce that the RSG cash limit is to be reduced by at least £300 million before allowing any offset to the teachers' pay settlement. Her view is that if this figure is announced now, the amount of offset attaching in due course to the teacher's pay settlement will become known; and she thinks it would be best to avoid this.

I am sending a copy of this letter to the Private Secretaries to the Lord President, the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Education and Scotland, and to Martin Vile (Cabinet Office).

Dear Minister,

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE

I wish to reinforce my request to you at Cabinet and subsequently
on Thursday.

We agreed, of course, at Cabinet yesterday, to the need to seek
public expenditure savings substantially larger than those
originally proposed and John Biffen is to report back to Cabinet
on 21 May. I would be grateful if you could as a matter of
urgency propose a target guideline for public expenditure
reductions.

I would hope you could state this in the form of a fixed percentage
reduction in all programmes. It would then be for each of our
colleagues to demonstrate why any programme should be exempt.
Some obviously will be but even here compensating reductions may
be found elsewhere in Departments.

I find it very difficult to see how one can know without such
guidelines either what scale of retrenchment is expected, or the
target of public expenditure reductions required to meet your
taxation reduction targets, or to know that the agony is being
shared fairly throughout national and local government.

Dear Minister,

In the proposals put forward by Treasury Ministers for cuts in public expenditure (C(79)1) we did not seek a major contribution from your department. We do, however, ask you to consider in this context what policy changes you could make to cover two items for which you are responsible. In each case expenditure in 1979-80 is expected to exceed existing provision and would otherwise give rise to a claim on the Contingency Reserve.

The more important item is expenditure on the Thames Barrier which is expected to exceed this year's provision of £1m. The other expenditure is on hill sheep allowances where the excess is 30.8m.

I hope you can find offsetting savings to cover these items.

Expenditure on the Thames Barrier is also expected to exceed existing provision in 1980-81 to 1982-83. We can, however, consider how to deal with this in the context of the Public Expenditure Survey.

"The Chancellor wanted the Prime Minister to be aware of his most recent thinking on the presentation of some of the Cabinet's decisions on reductions in public expenditure, following discussions he has had last night and this morning with the Secretaries of State for Education and for the Environment. You will already have received from Mr. Carlisle's Private Secretary the text agreed between the Chancellor and the Secretary of State governing the Government's broad approach on RSG and pay settlements. There are however severe limitations on the progress likely to be made in the teachers' pay negotiations in the absence of any clear statement of the Government's intentions regarding RSG. Furthermore, it will be difficult, and not at all useful, to try to sustain the position where the Lord President will have revealed to the Civil Service Staff Side the position of central government pay-related cash limits, whilst the Government will have made only qualitative statements about reductions in RSG.

The Chancellor therefore proposes, subject of course to the Prime Minister's views, to include in his speech during the Debate on the Address on Tuesday 22 May a passage on the following lines:

(i) Some general remarks about the Government's approach to public expenditure.

(ii) The Government's intention not to increase cash limits to take account of prices increases larger than originally provided for, and to increase the wage-related elements of central government cash limits by 1 per cent less than would be needed to cover the Civil Service pay settlement in full.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE CUTS : THE AID PROGRAMME

It has been agreed that I should reply on behalf of the FCO to your letter of 25 May to Alastair Pirie asking for a note distinguishing the different degrees of commitment applying to the various categories of expenditure included in the current Aid Programme.

I understand that the information immediately required relates to the 1979/80 disbursements. A note which sets out the expenditure expected to arise during 1979/80 under the different types of commitment. Experience in administering the aid programme over the years has shown that there is always a significant shortfall in expenditure against the provisions made at the beginning of the year although it is imposisble to forecast at all accurately under which items in the programme the underspending will occur. In order to spend the total agreed resources available as nearly as possible, we have, with the agreement of the Treasury, assumed figures for planning purposes higher than will actually arise in any given year. In the current year, therefore, planned expenditure was set at £1,035 million against a gross figure of £902 million included in the Estimates for the year.

Dear Mr.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SAVINGS

Thank you for sending me a copy of your letter of 27 May to Michael Heseltine in which you indicated that you looked to the Department of Industry to find savings totalling £215 million in 1979-80 (i.e £225m minus the £10m which you proposed in C(79)4 should be used from the £150m and VED programmes). This is a £150 million more than in your earlier proposals.

I am of course anxious to do everything possible to help you to achieve the larger target for total savings in 1979-80 which you have now set. I must however make the point that my Department's programmes are being asked to find a disproportionate share of the total. I understand that you are seeking a reduction of about 5% in total expenditure (excluding defence and law and order). A 3% reduction in this Department's programmes would produce only about £60 million.

So in my view the much larger cuts I shall be suggesting in this letter should only be made if all our other colleagues can also meet in full the revised targets you have set them, so clearly the way for the really substantial budget tax cuts that are needed to give industry new impetus and incentive.

If I am to save as much as £150 million more in 1979-80, I must find the largest part from the Regional Development Grants scheme. Since grants are paid some time in arrears the only way in which a large saving can be made in the short term is to impose a moratorium on payments. Our predecessors did this in 7/78 and the strong objections that were expressed still apply. In particular, a four month moratorium will deprive industry of an inflow of £30 million on which they will have been relying in their cash flow forecasts and it will be only a postponement of Government expenditure rather than a real cut. Nevertheless I can see no other way of finding immediate savings of anything approaching this scale. A moratorium will not be seen as the last word on changes in the Regional Aid package and it will be important to reach early conclusions on the future shape of that policy.",1979-05-24,Department of Industry,"The Rt Hon John Biffen MP, Chief Secretary to the Treasury",PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SAVINGS,letter,PREM 19-18/0001/-67.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter is addressed to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and discusses public expenditure savings that the Treasury is requesting from the Department of Industry.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE CUTS 1979-80

I am replying to your letter of 21 May 1979. Our main areas of expenditure are the MSC's grant-in-aid and the special employment measures carried on the Department's vote. I have personally been through the various items of expenditure in these two areas. I have also discussed the various possibilities for cuts in the grant-in-aid with the Chairman of the MSC who had been mandated by the full Commission to act on their behalf. I have had regard to the cost effectiveness of the various programmes, to our general approach in this area as adumbrated in the Manifesto and since, and to the need to minimise, to the maximum extent possible, the impact on unemployment.

My proposed savings are listed in the note appended to this letter and you will see that they add up to £172 million which is more than the figure of £160 million mentioned in your letter. In other words, my approach has not been to find cuts amounting to the lower figure but to cut back those programmes which I thought could be cut back to the maximum extent possible. This has not been carried through without a great deal of thought, pain and grief.

I have tried to be rigorous on this, assuming other colleagues will be too, despite the damaging effects on unemployment in the short term. The effect on unemployment was a main consideration I had in mind, but it is not possible to cut expenditure on the Department of Employment's vote without producing an effect on unemployment. The cuts imply, therefore, extra expenditure on social security benefits and staff.",1979-05-24,Treasury,Rt Hon John Biffen MP,Public expenditure cuts 1979-80,Letter,PREM 19-18/0001/-59.jpg,Department for Work and Pensions,"The letter discusses public expenditure cuts related to the Manpower Services Commission's grant-in-aid and the special employment measures carried on the Department's vote.

Dear John,

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SAVINGS 1979/80

Thank you for sending me a copy of your letter of 21 May to Michael Heseltine in which you indicated that you were looking to the Department of Trade to contribute £5 million towards the overall target for public expenditure cuts in the present year.

As you suggest, abolition of the Price Commission should produce the larger part of this sum. A little will depend on the precise date for the formal dissolution of the Commission and on the redundancy terms agreed for contract staff, but at present I expect that there will be a saving of rather more than £5 million in 1979/80.

In addition, the decision we have already announced to end support for local price surveys will save a further £0.5 million.

I have also decided to discontinue the support which the previous government gave to Consumer Advice Centres since these centres serve a costly and ineffective way of helping the consumer. There are however strong arguments in favour of giving some notice before putting this decision into operation, in particular to allow time for the Citizens Advice Bureaux to make the necessary arrangements to meet the extra demand which will fall on them. Nevertheless, if I make an early announcement that no support to the Centres will be provided after the end of 1979/80, there is bound to be a gradual winding-down of the Centres' activities during the rest of this year and I expect as a consequence to save another £0.5 million.

The Memorandum which I circulated to Cabinet on the scope for cuts in 1979/80 - C(79)4) - proposed reductions of £750-850 million (the proposals in the Annex plus proposals in Scotland and Northern Ireland). We agreed at Cabinet that the aim should be to find extra savings of £500-600 million and that I should formulate targets for reduction by each Department.

I attach an allocation. As pointed out in the Cabinet discussion we cannot tackle this by blanket percentage reductions: the need is to ensure that every Minister makes the maximum savings possible within his own programme. I have therefore started from the proposals in my Memorandum and in scaling them up I have taken account of our priorities and of what is likely to be practicable in the remainder of 1979-80. I indicate in the attachment some areas for reductions which I have had in mind but it will of course be for the Ministers concerned to make equivalent or larger savings in other ways.

I hope that, in the light of Thursday's Cabinet decisions, you and our other colleagues will accept these reductions and, in consultation with the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales on the programmes covering Great Britain as a whole, let me know in broad terms how you propose to implement them in your respective areas of responsibility.

The measures proposed should be additional to those resulting from our agreed cash limits policy this year and, in the case of the nationalised industries and other bodies, to the proceeds of sales which are being discussed separately with the Ministers concerned.

Review of Expenditure Programmes:
C(79)10 and 11

Having done some rough calculations on the basis proposed by the Chief Secretary in C(79)11, I think it is quite clear that the options which spending Ministers are being asked to identify in PESC will not provide the Cabinet with a realistic choice from which they could achieve their objective of reducing expenditure to the level of 1977-78 over the next 3-4 years.

Dear John,

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1979-80

This is my response to your letter of 21 May to Michael Heseltine. You told me when we met yesterday that your figure of £60m for me included the arts and libraries as well as education and science; and our officials are in touch with the Chancellor of the Duchy's about his contribution.

Meanwhile my proposals for saving £58m at 1979 Survey prices (compared with Cmnd 7439 revalued) on education in England and Wales and universities and science in Great Britain are:-

i. Abandon pilot schemes for 16-18 grants			£10m
ii. Miscellaneous savings on education				£11m
iii. Reduction in Science Budget					£4m
iv. Raise charge for school meals from 25p to 55p in September 1979	£22m
v. Recurrent grant to universities (including Open University) and voluntary colleges							£6m
vi. Educational building						£5m

Total						£58m

Further details are given in the Annex. I have avoided as far as possible cuts in capital expenditure, as you requested; and, with the school meals charge, have concentrated on an item which will do the least damage to the education service and bring substantially larger savings in subsequent years. Even so, taken with the effect on education of the effects on other items like the Treasury cuts, this will not be painless.

In view of the preparations you are now making for the budget and the discussions we are having on public expenditure I hope you may find it helpful to have an account of how we see the economic outlook in Scotland. I am to have a standing shortly with Keith Joseph to discuss regional policy but I am concerned that any forthcoming changes in policy should be seen against the wider economic background.

The various economic forecasts for the UK economy, though differing in detail, all agree that unemployment during 1979 is likely to rise. In part this is a consequence of the low growth rate in world trade, and in part the result of our own weak export performance stemming from the combination of a strong and stable currency with rising unit costs of production; but the result is that economic growth in the UK is unlikely to match the economies' natural growth in productive potential so that there will be an increasing surplus of unemployed labour.

Recent economic performance in Scotland has, if anything, been slightly weaker than for the UK as a whole; and with a serious situation affecting a number of our major industries, notably shipbuilding, we would expect this weaker performance also to be a feature of the year ahead. With seasonally adjusted unemployment in Scotland now at 7.5%, this means that levels of between 8 and 10% for Scotland as a whole, and much higher in difficult areas such as Strathclyde, are quite probable next winter without any change in existing policies.

There is of course very widespread concern over unemployment in Scotland, particularly in Strathclyde, and over the difficulties faced by some of our major industries. There is no doubt that this was a major factor in the Scottish election results and I have made it clear publicly that I attach the highest priority to bringing the level of unemployment down. For the longer term can in no doubt reduced levels of direct taxation and a reduction in the cost of finance for industries through lower interest rates can a one-requisite for fostering entrepreneurship and stronger economic growth. But the benefits of these measures will take time to work through. In the short term increased personal disposable income as a result of tax reductions is likely, particularly with the present strong exchange rate, to result in increased imports of consumption goods, while the offsetting reductions in public expenditure which we must make will necessarily give rise to higher levels of unemployment.",1979-05-24,Scottish Office,"The Rt Hon Sir Geoffrey Howe QC MP

Thank you for your letter of 21 May.

I am content to find reductions in expenditure amounting to £45m as you propose, above the cash limit savings. I understand that £20m of this reduction will be found by the Welsh Office as it relates also to their programmes.

The £430m therefore will be found as follows:-

Community Land        £50m

Water authorities (England) £55m
EBA                 £25m

The remaining £313m will be found from the Housing Programme, which will find the £140m necessary cash limit savings. My officials will be in touch with yours to spell out the precise details.

In the time available it has not been possible to make precise judgements but if the expected savings do not materialise in one or more of my programmes to match the reductions sought, I shall ensure that compensating savings are made elsewhere.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE

You wrote to Geoffrey Howe on 18 May suggesting that the public expenditure cuts in 1979-80 might be achieved by a fixed percentage reduction in all programmes.

The policy on cash limits agreed by Cabinet, including the cut in the rate support grant, will produce a generalised squeeze on the areas concerned of the sort you propose. But I do not think that we can take this general approach too far. As was pointed out in the Cabinet discussion, and as Mark Carlisle has repeated in a subsequent letter, we have to take account of the different circumstances affecting the various programmes.

First, we have to have regard to the Manifesto commitments, notably on defence and law and order. Second, the practicability of cuts differs between programmes. For example, the demand-determined programmes such as social security offer little scope for cuts, particularly in the short-term.

The allocation which I proposed in my letter of 21 May attempts to take account of the factors I have mentioned above. I hope you will accept it. The proposed cuts are proportionately largest for the industrial and employment programmes, followed by the housing programme: this is not out of line with the distribution which the work we did in Opposition would lead us to expect.",1979-05-23,"Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street, SW1P 3AG","The Rt Hon Michael Heseltine MP, Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 3EB",PUBLIC EXPENDITURE,Letter,PREM 19-18/0001/-92.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter is addressed to the Secretary of State for the Department of the Environment, but the key decisions and policy discussions are being made by the Treasury.

After we spoke, the question arose whether the decision to drop the increase in prescription charges included dropping the increase in dental charges, which would yield about £6 million this year. The paper has been written on the assumption that the two go together. This seemed the most reasonable interpretation of the decision, but I am advised that it would be possible to distinguish them, and if you wanted to persevere with the proposal to increase dental charges, it would be a simple matter to amend the paper over the weekend.

This is to confirm that the Prime Minister is content with the draft paper which you sent under cover of your letter of 25 May. Indeed, she regards the degree of cooperation which most Ministers have displayed in fulfilling the target cut of £1.4 billion for this year as highly satisfactory. In relation to this target, only two points appear remaining to be resolved - a further cut of £22 million in the education and science programme and a further £10 million cut in the aid programme.
The Prime Minister has commented that these cuts must be found by the two Departments concerned.

Public Expenditure

Attached are two papers which the Chief Secretary wishes
to circulate for Thursday's Cabinet.

There are three points on the main paper (Flag A) which
I think you may want to consider:

i.	There is no discussion of what should be the
overall level of public expenditure cuts, and no decision
is asked for on what should be the cuts objective.  There
is merely a reference in paragraph 4 to the ""broad objective
stated in Opposition of bringing expenditure back to the
1977/78 level"".  Mr. Biffen, in his covering note, implies
that it will not be possible to take a firm view of the
total level of cuts until he has considered the options
for individual programmes.  There is certainly something
in this approach.  On the other hand, it might concentrate
the minds of spending Ministers if Cabinet were to come
to a firm view right away that public expenditure in 1982/83
is to be cut by some minimum figure.

ii.	The formula in paragraph 6 for the putting forward of
cuts options is not accompanied by any estimate of what
this would produce if all the options were accepted.  The
Treasury tell me that it would in fact fall £2 billion short
of meeting the objective of getting public expenditure back
to 1977/78 levels.  If we are to take the latter as our
minimum objective, it seems to me that the formula is totally
useless.  It must surely at least produce enough to achieve

I mentioned to you that, at the meeting which the Prime Minister had with Treasury Ministers and Permanent Secretaries last week, she asked for a note setting out precisely how much of the Aid Programme was already committed.

Review of Public Expenditure Programmes
1980/81 to 1983/84

The Prime Minister has considered the Chief Secretary's minute of 21 May and the two draft papers accompanying it which he intends to circulate for Cabinet on Thursday.

The Prime Minister has commented on the options formula set out in paragraph 6 of the main paper. She has asked that the percentage figure should be at least large enough to show total public expenditure savings which would get public expenditure back to the 1977/78 level. I understand that this would mean substituting the figure of 15% for the figure of 5% in the draft.

But the figure of 15% would only achieve the 1977/78 objective if all the options put forward by Ministers were accepted. The Prime Minister thinks that, in order to give Ministers some choices to look at, it would be wise to have a somewhat higher figure; and she has herself suggested that it should be 17%.

It would be helpful if the paper could spell out the basis on which the revised formula has been calculated.

Subject to the above revisions, the Prime Minister is content for the two papers to be circulated to Cabinet.

Dear John 

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1979/80: BRITISH GAS CORPORATION AND BRITISH NATIONAL OIL CORPORATION 

At our brief discussion last Thursday evening, 24 May, it was proposed that a further £500 million towards reducing the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement in 1979/80 should be contributed by selling some of the oil producing assets of the British Gas Corporation (BGC) and the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC). 

I am now examining how to do this and have had initial discussions with Lord Kearton and Sir Denis Rooke. They will be reporting to me later this week their assessment of the means and implications of finding £500 million from the BNOC and £200 million from the BGC. Both are not unexpectedly hostile to the idea of such operations. Notwithstanding, I believe that progress can be made in meeting your request. However the policy of selling state assets raises issues of wider Government policy, going beyond the interests of my Department, and I consider that our Cabinet colleagues should have at least a brief opportunity of discussing those issues when they consider tomorrow your proposals for public expenditure reductions in 1979/80. 

First, specific decisions to dispose of BNOC's and BGC's assets taken in the immediate context of the Budget statement will not, of course, give us time to consider thoroughly the implications for our strategy for the nationalised industries and for the scope for introducing private shareholding generally. An immediate selling operation is likely to benefit mainly the few companies which are well placed, through their partnerships in the oilfields in question or for some other reason. This raises the important issue of our objectives for wider personal ownership, including shares in public sector industries where there is scope for this.",1979-05-30,"A M Hatling, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY","Mr David Howell MP, Chief Secretary to the Treasury",PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1979/80: BRITISH GAS CORPORATION AND BRITISH NATIONAL OIL CORPORATION,Letter,PREM 19-18/0001/-31.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses reducing the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement in 1979/80 through the sale of assets of the British Gas Corporation (BGC) and the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC), which falls under the remit of HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry.",1979-06-27

CASH LIMITS 1979-80

At the Cabinet's discussion on 17th May about cash limits for 1979-80, it was agreed that if additional resources were needed for the defence or for the law and order programmes, each should be separately considered by the appropriate committees as increases in the public expenditure allocation for the year, and not as exceptions to the cash limits policy.

2. The previous Government had set cash figures for the defence budget which under-provided for the programmes to which they related. As recorded in C(79)13, the Chief Secretary and I are agreed that an extra £100M is necessary to be added to the defence budget in 1979-80. This will cater for Naval requirements (fleet submarines, Type 42 destroyers and Type 22 frigates); contract refitting of ships (to help make up the backlog of work resulting from last year's industrial troubles); increased spending on the Milan anti-tank guided weapon and increases in planned spending on air systems, which include £30M this year for the Tornado aircraft.

3. The £100M will enable these programmes to go forward as planned. They represent important and necessary additions to our armoury. I am, however, determined that the Ministry of Defence should play its full part in the search for economies and the elimination of waste. The Ministry will also, of course, work within the cash limits and civil pay guidelines which have been agreed for all Departments, and will find the savings necessary (estimated at about £150M) to absorb these cuts. In particular, I shall not be seeking any addition to the cash limit on account of improvements in Forces' conditions of service, TAVR bounties or pay increases for MOD Police.",1912-02-08,Ministry of Defence,Prime Minister,Cash Limits 1979-80,Letter,PREM 19-18/0001/-25.jpg,Ministry of Defence,"The letter discusses additional funding needed for the defence budget, including for naval requirements, contract refitting of ships, and increases in planned spending on air systems.

I should be grateful to hear from you and the other colleagues concerned by 24 May so that I can report back to Cabinet in the following week. 

There are two further points to which I draw your attention. I recognise the limitations on cutting expenditure in 1979-80 but such reductions are to be preferred to capital expenditure and, in general, to increases in charges. Second, we must avoid choosing reductions in 1979-80 of a kind which will increase our problems in reducing expenditure in 1980-81 or later years. The importance of achieving sufficient reductions in the figures we have inherited for those years will be quite as great as for the current year.

If you or any other colleagues would like to discuss the means by which the reductions should be achieved, I would gladly arrange that.

DEAR NEAL

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1979-80

You sent me a copy of your letter of 29 May to the Chief
Secretary, in which you propose that I should find £5
million from the Arts Budget for the current year. I saw
this only this afternoon. The proposal is wholly unaccept-
able to me.

When the Chief Secretary wrote to his colleagues on 21 May
proposing targets for departmental savings, there was no
suggestion that your target of £60 million should include
the Arts. I was rather surprised to learn subsequently,
but not from John Biffen himself, that the Arts were
intended to be so included. At that stage the suggestion
which was passed on to me was that I should contribute £2
million. To communicate such a message by another Cabinet
colleague and not to approach me direct was of course
discourteous to me. However, in view of the state of flux
which a new Government inevitably finds itself in I decided

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SAVINGS 1979/80

Thank you for copying to me your letter of 21 May to Michael Heseltine, in which you sought from me a contribution of £200m towards savings in the current financial year.

I am writing to confirm what I told you last Thursday, namely that I expect to be able to find the additional £15Bm now asked of me. I expect this to come primarily from further increases in electricity and gas prices, though I cannot yet say in detail how the sum will be made up. I hope to get a clearer picture later this week. I will also be writing later today with details of the progress I have made on the sale of BNOC and BGC's assets.

PRIME MINISTER

Public Expenditure: Scope for Cuts
(C(79) 4)

BACKGROUND

This paper by the Chief Secretary represents the first step in a
longer term programme of cuts in public expenditure.  Further proposals
covering the arrangements for reviewing expenditure for 1980-83 will be
before the Cabinet next week.  And a full-scale review will take place after
the Budget with a report back to Cabinet in the summer.  The paper makes a
mixture of proposals, some of which are for immediate decision and others
for further discussion with spending Departments.  Bilateral discussions
are planned for next week and the Chief Secretary would then intend to bring
his specific proposals for decision to Cabinet.  Given the Budget timetable
the most convenient date for a meeting of the Cabinet for this purpose is
likely to be 31st May.

2.  In addition to running through his own suggestions the Chief Secretary
will put considerable emphasis on his proposal that Ministers in charge of
spending Departments should consider urgently whether they can offer any
further savings this year.  He does not say how much he wants in further cuts
but his present suggestions appear modest and of course it is by no means
certain that Cabinet will adopt all of them.  You may therefore feel that it
would be worthwhile putting spending Ministers on their mettle by asking
that all their suggestions for additional savings should be forwarded to the
Chief Secretary by, say, Monday of next week with copies to you for
information.

HANDLING

3.  If you adopt my suggestion in the covering brief that you, and possibly
the Chancellor, should make a scene-setting introduction to the three
expenditure papers, you could probably tackle this paper by moving straight",1979-05-01,Chief Secretary,Prime Minister,Public Expenditure: Scope for Cuts,Letter,PREM 19-18/0001/-139.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses public expenditure cuts and budget proposals, which fall within the remit of HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry responsible for setting the direction of the UK's economic policy and public spending.",1979-05-29

29 May 1979

Dear John,
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1979-80

In paragraph 3ii of C(79)43 you recommend an increase in the school meals charge of 5p, as assumed by our predecessors, and not by 10p, as you yourself suggested in C(79)4 and as I proposed in my letter of 24 May; you also recommend that the difference of 5p should be found from education, science and the arts budgets.

You will appreciate that most current expenditure on education, four-fifths of my total programme, is borne by local education authorities and is therefore outside the scope of the present exercise - though it may be seriously affected by the cuts in rate support grant that we intend to make. The possible areas for savings other than school meals are therefore effectively limited to the research Councils; the arts; further and higher education fees; and university and local authority capital spending.

I have not, in the time available, been able to consult Norman St John Stevas about the arts budget, but assume that he would be prepared to agree that a further reduction of £3m (which would amount to proportionate cuts for education and the arts) would be reasonable. So far as the other 5.1m is concerned, I have considered again whether it would be practicable to increase the cuts I originally proposed for the Research Councils and universities in the current financial year; but I fear that after very careful scrutiny of existing commitments, I feel that there no is scope for doing so. This leaves only two areas where further savings might be made.

The first of these is in further and higher education fees. Our predecessors announced in March a 9 percent increase in these fees from September to maintain their real value. A further increase of 20 percent would yield about £5m in 1979-80. The majority of home students would have the increased fees met in their awards. Half the savings would fall on the remaining self-financed home students (many of whom recently experienced the recent fees increases not in their awards).",1979-05-29,DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE,The Rt Hon John Biffen MP,PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1979-80,Letter,PREM 19-18/0001/-35.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter is addressed to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, discussing public expenditure and potential savings in the education, science and arts budgets.

"The Government's concern in this area is recognised to be different, but Ministers will wish to be closely informed of significant developments in good time. This will of course require the co-operation of the Chairmen of the corporations.

Meanwhile, we shall arrange for the group under Dixon to monitor the nationalised industries also.

From the Private Secretary

The Prime Minister notes that, after further consideration following the E meeting on 15 October, the Chancellor has provisionally recommended that it would be preferable not to make a change in the method of cash limit calculation to abate the provision next year for groups who had staged settlements last year, nor to adjust 1980-81 cash limits downwards to reflect the reduced pay provision for settlements between now and the end of the financial year.  It seems unlikely that any other Minister will take a different view, and the Prime Minister proposes therefore that a decision on the paper E(80)122 should be deferred until after Cabinet has taken the substantive decision on the pay assumption for the new cash limits.  On that basis, the meeting of E arranged for this evening has been cancelled.

She has also noted your view that the fortnightly note would probably not cover the nationalised industries, but that the Chairman might be asked by their sponsor Minister to forewarn them at least three days in advance of making any pay offer. The Prime Minister hopes that nationalised industries' pay can be covered as far as possible under the new arrangements. She would therefore hope that the fortnightly note would include all available information on their pay negotiations. She would also much prefer to see Ministers having about 7 days' notice of the intention to make a claim.

Dear Mike,

CO-ORDINATION OF INFORMATION ON PUBLIC SERVICE PAY

At a meeting last week the Prime Minister said she would
like some arrangements to be set up in Whitehall to make
sure that she and some other Ministers are kept properly
informed of developments on pay in the public services.
Before he went on holiday, Tim Lankester said that the
Prime Minister would like to know exactly what was intended
before the arrangements are put into effect.

The purpose of these arrangements will be purely the gathering
and co-ordination of information. There is no intention that
they should be used to discuss policy. The aim will be to let
the Prime Minister, the Chancellor, the Secretary of State for
Employment and possibly one or two other Ministers have a
regular note (we suggest fortnightly) setting out the facts
about recent developments in public service pay cases and
events expected in the month ahead. This will enable
Ministers to intervene in good time if they wish to do so
and make sure that relationships between events in various
parts of the public services are not missed.

We understand that the Prime Minister would prefer the
arrangements to be informal and not managed by the Cabinet
Office, partly because of the danger of misinterpretation
if their existence was leaked. What we propose is that the
relevant Treasury Under Secretary should convene a group
which would consist of the Under Secretary or Assistant
Secretary concerned in the Department of Employment, CSD
and Cabinet Office, together with someone from No.10. The
Treasury would chair this group and provide the secretary.

For this purpose we assume that the public services cover
all employees of the central government including the NHS
and local government. The group would establish contacts
with the appropriate people in the DHSS, the Department of
the Environment, the Department of Education, the Scottish
Office and the Home Office. This group will have access to
information on pay developments in virtually the whole of
the public services.

Mr. John Hoskyns sent me a copy of his minute of 18 September commenting on Michael Heseltine's minute of 16/September about the arbitration exercise affecting the local authority Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clerical (APTC) grades. I think this provides an opportunity to consider a general short-coming in our existing arbitration arrangements.

At present there appears to have been a tendency for arbitrators to ""split the difference"" between the claim by the unions and the offer by the management. This pays no regard to ability to pay and provides a positive encouragement to the unions to increase their wage bids.

My own idea would be to ensure that all arbitrators should be required to take account of the general interest when reaching their recommendations. An alternative would be to require arbitrators to decide in favour of either the management offer or the unions' claim without giving them scope for choosing any intermediate amount. In either case arbitrators should be obliged to specify the cost of implementing their proposals and should make recommendations on how the money should be raised.

I am not sure how such a change could be implemented. One /possibility ...

ARBITRATION ON PUBLIC SERVICE PAY

You wrote to me on 2 October about your concerns on the use of
arbitration for the pay of local authority employees and more
generally. In replying, I also comment on some ideas Keith Joseph
put forward in a minute to the Prime Minister of the same date.

The only sure way by which employees can avoid the risk of an
arbitrator coming to an award beyond their ability to pay is to
stand on their final offer and refuse to accept that an independent
third party should be invited to determine their pay bill. If
employers accept arbitration, on any practical test they are committed
to accept the outcome. Uniquely in the public sector there are
procedural agreements which provide unilateral access to arbitration
and I readily agree that, provided with this option, unions might
well choose to discover whether an arbitrator might make an award
above the employer's last offer rather than conclude a negotiated
settlement.

The immediate issue with which you are concerned clearly illustrates the
point. The local authority employers, under their freely negotiated
arbitration agreement, have agreed - albeit reluctantly - that the union
can put the pay claim to Arbitration. Should they not be urgently considering, given the extent of their
concerns, changing their agreement? This is the main issue to which the paper
which I have put to G Committee on Arbitration in the public services
is addressed. It is important to note that S.3 of the Employment
Protection Act 1975 prevents ACAS from referring any dispute to
arbitration without the consent of all the parties to that dispute.

As to your suggestions, I entirely agree that an arbitrator should take
fully into account an employer's ability to pay, although the concept of
what that might be does not always afford an absolute test. Even where
the arbitrator's terms of reference do not specifically include this
consideration, there is nothing to prevent employees arguing it, once
before the arbitrator. Indeed, it must be expected that they would do so.
And an arbitrator is most unlikely to ignore evidence from either party
or ever likely to dismiss so important a consideration.",1980-10-13,Caxton House Tothill Street London SW1H 9NA,"Rt Hon Michael Heseltine MP

PUBLIC SECTOR PAY - E

1. You will have seen our paper on public sector pay. The approach is so different from that suggested in the CPRS agenda that it is difficult to reconcile the two. How, therefore, to proceed?

2. This paper suggests how you might reconcile the two positions and direct the discussion.

3. Assuming the colleagues have all seen our paper, you could introduce the discussion on the following lines:

(1) We are currently addressing a number of interconnected tasks. We can't decide how to handle MPs' pay without also taking a view on the other TSRB recommendations. But we can't do that, except within the context of an agreed approach to public sector pay (unless we try to treat TSRB as the last of the present round, which could be a lost opportunity which turns into a dangerous new problem). And public sector pay itself cannot be discussed except in the context of the MTFS and the PES - to give us the sort of numbers the Policy Unit's paper is groping for.

(2) Today's meeting will continue working through the CPRS agenda as it is helpful to walk the course, even though we cannot quantify the problem in each area and thus what has to be achieved.

(3) Can we speed up the assessment of risks, especially those of selective disruption in the Civil Service, currently being looked at by E(CS)?

4. I don't know what the detailed plans for the 3 July presentation are, but you might like to raise the question of numbers (implications of breaking MTFS, the implicit cash limits) when you see Geoffrey tomorrow morning.

Dear Chancellor,

I have a direct interest in the proposal in paragraphs 6(a) and 11(c) of your paper E(80)118 and I set out the background more fully here before we discuss this with our colleagues on Thursday.

The staging of settlements resulting from comparability studies was not a device to circumvent cash limit control, but a requirement imposed by successive Governments.  The objective was to reduce the cost of settlements in the short term and that was achieved.  But there was a clear understanding that the full cost would ultimately be covered and indeed as you point out in your paper we met this obligation in 1980-81 for the various comparability settlements where staging was complete by the end of 1979-80.

I recognise that you wish to avoid a repetition in the future, But if our policy on pay and cash limits is to succeed, it must be seen to be fair and reasonable.  I can see no logic in singling out for special treatment in the determination of cash limits for 1981-82 only those whose final staging of ""comparability"" settlements fell during 1980-81 (that is school, further education and university teachers).  In other words, we would be accused of deliberately penalising those whose comparability studies and settlements were either delayed for one reason or another outside their control or who accepted longer periods of staging for the payment of their award.

Hence while I entirely agree that we must set rules for the operation of cash limits in 1981-82 which seek to avoid further difficulties for us in the future, I do not think we should apply new rules retrospectively to settlements in the 1979/80 pay round.

"Dear Margaret,

As you know I have argued throughout the series of articles I have sent you over the last three years or so that a monetary policy can only be effective if the Government takes a firm and coherent line over public sector pay. Otherwise, since pay is almost 50% of the expenditure covered by cash limits, the PSBR will rise and the money supply can then only be controlled by the use of a very high MLR and other interest rates.

At present we still do not have what I have described as a ""real"" monetarist policy based on a low PSBR which only requires low rates of interest to control the money supply but a ""phoney"" monetarist policy with a high PSBR which demands high interest rates to control the money supply. This is difficult to distinguish from a real old-fashioned deflation.

I am glad the importance of this crucial difference between the two ways of controlling the money supply now seems to be generally understood, but unless we get a grip on public sector pay, attempts to get our policy right will fail. I thought, therefore, I should send you this copy of an article covering related points which I wrote a short time ago.

I understand that both Geoffrey and John accept the criticisms I make in the article about the present system of cash limits and public sector pay. In addition a further device for circumventing effective control has now emerged. We are told that Civil Service pay increases of more than 20% are to be brought within the cash limits by delaying the starting date for the increases. This is a dangerous subterfuge either it raises the base on which next years pay increases are calculated, or alternatively, if we continue with pay research and tight cash limits the gap between the two will get larger and larger and increasingly difficult to defend.

Although some of the arguments I have put forward are now understood, I remain gravely concerned about the apparent lack of coordination of Government opposition to inflationary public sector pay claims. We are continuing to fudge the issue and pile up problems for the future. When we were in Government",1980-07-11,"The Rt. Hon.

Dear Secretary of State,

PUBLIC SECTOR PAY 1980-81

I have seen your minute of 8 September to the Prime Minister.

I have every sympathy with your wish to avoid appearing to intervene in public sector pay negotiations on grounds which are not supported by cash limit considerations. However, I do not think that the (EEA) decision requires you to do so.
The problem is one of timing. Until we reach our decisions on cash limits, and in particular the pay elements in cash limits, on 30 October, we cannot give clear indications to pay negotiators on what the cash limit provision will be. Further, we must remember that though the pay element in cash limits for FY 1980-81 is 14 per cent, even for settlements which fall in the 1980-81 ""pay round"", we may wish to adjust this element, as we did last year, to conform with whatever decisions we take on 30 October (though this year the adjustment would be downwards rather than upwards).

This means that if the UK AEA were to go ahead and negotiate on the basis indicated in your E(EA) paper, they might well end up with a settlement in excess of our final decisions on cash limits for this financial year and next.

I do not see why you should not be fairly open with the UK AEA on this problem. It would be up to them to decide whether or not to seek to delay negotiations until our final decisions are reached. But if they do not, then I think you must tell them that the only reasonable assumption on which they can proceed is that the final cash limit provision is likely to mean that they will need to settle within single figures. They should negotiate accordingly.",1980-09-12,"Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street, SWIP 3AG","The Rt Hon David Howell MP

PUBLIC SECTOR PAY 1980/81

I have seen Keith Joseph's minute reporting the discussion at Thursday's E(EA) Meeting on negotiations with the AEA's industrial staff. I have noted the Committee's conclusions.

While the Committee were right to assume that the immediate economic consequences of industrial action at AEA sites would not be significant, I fear that they may have under-estimated the other consequences, particularly the embarrassment to the Government's nuclear policy and the fact that prolonged strike action might jeopardise safety.

I need not trouble E Committee with this specific negotiation. I am however concerned at the wider implications of the decision which colleagues have reached in this case. My intervention in the negotiations is bound to become known, and will be seen as a significant departure from our policies hitherto, under which management have been free, within the constraints of cash limits, to decide for themselves how to conduct negotiations.

Before I commit colleagues to a new course by this action, I believe we should have an early discussion in E Committee, not necessarily on Wednesday, on the basis of a paper by Geoffrey Howe on pay policy in the public sector. A discussion of the general issue at this stage is, I believe, necessary if we are not to run the risk of evolving a public sector pay policy by a series of ad hoc decisions on particular cases.",1980-09-26,Prime Minister,Mr. Wilson,PUBLIC SECTOR PAY 1980/81,Letter,PREM 19-182/0001/-97.jpg,"Prime Minister's Office, No. 10 Downing Street","The letter is addressed to the Prime Minister and discusses high-level issues of public sector pay policy and the government's approach to managing industrial relations, which fall within the remit of the Prime Minister's Office.",1980-10-24

Thank you for your note of 7 October.

I will of course let the Treasury know if the Prime Minister reacts to future reports.

I am sure it is right that Sir Keith Joseph should receive a copy of the reports.

I am slightly puzzled by your paragraph 3.  I had understood that the reports would not recommend action on particular pay issues, but that the Treasury would make sure that either the Financial Secretary or the Chancellor was ""brought in to bat"" when they thought that intervention was desirable.  Now it seems that in some cases, recommendations for action are to be made; while in others, Ministers are going to be asked if they want to intervene.

It may well be that, if the reports are to be useful, they need to make suggestions for action.  But I do not think it should be left to the Prime Minister to have to apply her mind as to whether or not to intervene in particular cases.  Of course, in major cases, she will no doubt want to take a view.  But I think that the responsibility for thinking about particular cases should rest, at least initially, with Treasury Ministers.

Dear Geoffrey,

At E Committee on 17 June we were asked to consider the
possibility of splitting the present cash limit on Civil
Service pay between Departments. Although you were invited
to be in the lead on this I thought you might find it
helpful to have my views before going further.

Put in those terms the proposition presents no problems since
it is precisely what we already do. The CSD do not hold a
bag of gold for the whole CIVIL Service; each Department has
its own cash limit and has to live within it. The equitable
distribution of the total among Departments is never easy
because of the widely differing grade mixes, and that is
one reason why we prefer to leave it until we know what pay
increases the various grades are to receive. But I am in no
doubt that we should not attempt to operate a single
centralised cash limit.

But I suppose what we are asked to consider is not just the
distribution of the cash limit to Departments but a freedom
of each, within its cash limit, to fix its own rates of pay.
There is already some scope for this with industrials through
productivity bargaining, - although even here experience has
shown that unless firm central control of policy is maintained
there is ample scope for paying for pious hopes rather than
proved performance.

I do not deny that it has its attractions for me personally.
It would spare us a great deal of difficult and time-consuming
work with the Unions and enable staff savings to be made by
rolling up the Pay Divisions.

Dear Sir,

PUBLIC SECTOR PAY: FORTNIGHTLY MONITORING REPORT

... I attach a note by Treasury Officials on pay negotiations in the public sector. It identifies three important issues for which no arrangements have yet been made for Ministerial consideration in addition to a number of other important issues which Ministers will be considering collectively.

In order to ensure that outstanding settlements from the 1979-80 pay round are presented as favourably as possible, we propose to write at official level to the Departments concerned reminding them of the importance of careful presentation of the settlements in order to minimise their repercussive impact.

The Chancellor will be writing to Mr Heseltine about the negotiations with the water workers and local authority manuals, and asking his views on the timing of the settlements. The Chancellor will also be consulting the Home Secretary about firemen's pay. He is disappointed that the original prospect of breaking away from index-linking is not (apparently) to be taken further, particularly as it seems likely to lead to a very high settlement (22 per cent). He understood that the Home Secretary hoped to be able to overturn the index-linking arrangement for firemen, which was established two years ago as a result of the firemen's strike in 1977.

Dear Bill,

PUBLIC SECTOR PAY

I am a little puzzled as to the no doubt impeccably pure motives behind the arrangements outlined in your letter of 14 August. You say the Treasury intend to establish new arrangements for ""collecting and providing Ministers with regular information about developments on public sector pay"".

But there is already an official committee on pay negotiations (PY) whose terms of reference are ""To co-ordinate the work of departments in relation to pay negotiations; and to report to Ministers as appropriate"".

Moreover PY produces a monthly pay brief on pay settlements and prospects which seems to cover exactly the same ground as that intended for the Treasury group. PY has not met since December of last year; in the interests of that efficiency which we are constantly being adjured to pursue, would it not be better to try and make the existing arrangements work more effectively than to set up a new group? Or is the intention that the existing arrangements should be dismantled?

If so, will someone please tell us.

Dear Geoffrey,

PUBLIC SERVICE PAY: ""OVERHANG""

At E Committee last week we discussed our approach to settling the pay factors for the cash limits of 1981-82. You will be making recommendations to Cabinet at its meeting next week.

One point in particular continues to concern me. This is the question of what you described in E(80)44 as ""overhang"". We must be clear about what this is involved. The ""overhang"" does not represent an advantage which has been gained by some groups. On the contrary, they were made to wait for the increases which it was agreed were due to them on 1 April. If we now insist that they have lower increases than others in the new pay round then we shall be using a past penalty to justify a further reduction in their incomes, thereby deducing twice over the deferment or staging of the last pay round.

I do not see how we can justify such treatment on grounds of public expenditure control, public service pay policy, justice or commonsense.

As I said at E - and the Prime Minister endorsed this more generally - into single figures and apply the same treatment to all public services, there is a good chance of getting away without serious industrial trouble. This would be in spite of the fact that given the likely level of inflation there will be a marked reduction in the real value of pay for those groups. But if on top of that we were to penalise some particular groups yet again because of last year's staging, we would provoke the unions to a degree of hostility of a much more serious order.

I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister and to those present at E Committee discussion.

This seems to be quite the wrong way round. If our objectives are to create a climate which is (a) conducive to low public sector settlements, and (b) which helps us to explain cause and effect to the public (these huge increases, including the private sector, have to be paid for in unemployment, high MLR, expenditure cuts, higher taxes), the high figures in the Survey strengthen our case. In any case, they are so horrendous, however we talk them down, compared with the realities of our situation, that we risk looking ridiculous if we appear to be investing great effort in making absurdly high figures look slightly less absurd.

CHILD TAX ALLOWANCES FOR NON-RESIDENT CHILDREN

You will wish to be aware of the fact that one of the measures
I will be announcing in my Budget Speech will be the
withdrawal of child tax allowances for overseas children.

The allowances will be withdrawn over a two year period,
starting in 1981/82 with a £200 reduction from the present
level (£365, £335 or £300 according to age) in 1981/82 and
complete withdrawal in 1982/83.

2. The withdrawal of these CTAs will complete the general
process of the withdrawal of child tax allowances, and their
replacement by child benefit, which was begun in 1977. The
phasing out of child tax allowances for non-resident children
was originally postponed by one year, but it was postponed
indefinitely in the Finance Act 1978 so that representations
could be considered. The continued existence of these
allowances is anomalous and the Ministers concerned (Home
Office, FCO and DHSS) agree that they should be abolished.
The decision to defer phasing out until 1981/82, and then to
withdraw the allowance over a two year period, should
minimise the impact of abolition and reduce criticism from
the immigrant community. The five year gap between the
original phasing out announcement and its final implementation
is long enough to ensure that virtually all the children who
were in the immigration pipeline at the start will have had
time to get to this country before abolition takes effect.

Dear Mr. Bennett,

You wrote to me on 8 April asking for a meeting to discuss the problems you believe development land tax causes London Transport and other statutory undertakers.

I am glad to learn that you regard the proposed advance notification procedures which the Chancellor announced in his Budget Statement as a useful step forward. This and the other detailed changes we are proposing follow from our consideration of the many representations we have received, and, as you may know, Lord Cockfield had a useful discussion with Mr. Bagnall towards the end of last year in which many aspects of development land tax were covered.

I feel bound to say, however, that in reviewing development land tax we have felt it important to be guided by the principle that the public and private sectors should be treated equally. It would in our view be quite wrong to treat one more favourably than the other. If nevertheless there are still matters of general application which you think could still be helpfully discussed, Lord Cockfield would be happy to meet you.

May I suggest, however, that you first re-assess your position in the light of the information in the Inland Revenue.",1980-05-12,The Prime Minister,Mr. Bennett,Development land tax and its impact on London Transport and other statutory undertakers,Letter,PREM 19-176/0001/-07.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses issues related to development land tax, which is a tax policy matter under the remit of HM Treasury.",1980-06-09

Dear Gene,

THE BUDGET: OVERSEAS REACTIONS

On the day of his Budget Statement, the Chancellor of the Exchequer sent a message, outlining the Budget measures, to his Finance Minister colleagues in the Economic Summit group of countries, in EC countries not in the Summit group, to the German Economics Minister, Count Lambsdorff, to the EC Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, M. Ortoli, and to the Managing Director of the IMF.

Such messages have been sent in the past, without causing much of a ripple. This time however there has been positive response, conveying much sympathy with and support for the Chancellor's approach and methods. The Chancellor finds this most encouraging, and thinks the Foreign Secretary and the other Cabinet colleagues may be interested in the (unusual) degree of overseas support the Budget strategy has received. The following paragraphs summarize the various reactions.

Secretary Miller expresses his strong support for ""our resolve to control inflation"", and his ""great interest"" in our ""elaboration of"" a medium-term financial strategy.

When he was in London with the Federal German Chancellor recently, Herr Lahnstein, State Secretary in the German Finance Ministry, said that the Germans had found the message ""extremely useful"": they had however been concerned about the message.

"As you know, the Chancellor called on the Prime Minister on Friday afternoon to outline his approach to the budget. They had before them his minute of 29 February.

The Chancellor said that the Treasury's pre-budget forecast was suggesting a rather higher fall in output in the coming year than most outside forecasters, at the same time, the forecast for the PSBR on the assumption of unchanged tax rates was approximately £8.9 billion - which was perhaps rather lower than might have been expected from the output forecast; in the forecast to be published as FSBR, he intended to show a less depressed output path in line with outside forecasters; but he did not think it would be right to be more optimistic about the PSBR. It would be better to show a PSBR target which could be met rather than be overly optimistic and run the risk of having to introduce supplementary fiscal measures in the autumn. As between the different sectors in the economy, the forecast was showing a substantial shift of resources into the oil sector and into the personal sector, and away from the non-oil corporate sector. This was reflected in a worsening of non-oil corporate liquidity. One of the objectives of the budget must be to reverse this shift.

As far as the monetary stance was concerned, he was proposing to roll forward the target range of 7-11% per annum to April 1981, with June 1979 remaining as the base. Given the likely overshooting of the target range for this financial year, a roll forward on these lines would represent as tight a stance as could be readily contemplated; on the other hand, to go for a more relaxed target would not be credible to the markets. He believed that a PSBR of £8-9 billion would be consistent with the 7-11% roll forward. Thus, in aggregate terms he was proposing a ""no change"" budget.

The Chancellor went on to explain that to index all the specific income and expenditure tax points and rates would involve a reduction of income tax of some £2 billion and an increase in indirect taxes of some £1 billion. £1 billion from indirect taxes would add about 1% to the RPI. He had yet to decide what combination of specific duty increases to go for; but he did not think it would be right to do more than this in total. Consequently, he was proposing to reduce the cuts in income tax to about £1 billion; and he intended to achieve this.",1980-03-03,From the Private Secretary,Dear John,10 DOWNING STREET,Letter,PREM 19-176/0001/-182.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter outlines details about the Chancellor's budget forecast and proposals, which fall under the remit of HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry.",1980-03-31

Dear Tim,

THE BUDGET AND THE COMPANY SECTOR

Your letter to me of 3 March records the Chancellor's undertaking to provide the Prime Minister with a note prepared by Treasury officials showing the substantial shift of resources currently taking place out of manufacturing and into the oil and personal sectors.

I now attach two notes by Messrs Burns and Middleton, the first of which sets out the general approach, while the second puts some figures on the extent of the transfer from the manufacturing sector.

I should perhaps add that although there is general agreement in the Treasury with the broad thrust of the Burns/Middleton analysis, the balance of opinion suggests that we should not be facing a crisis on the scale of 1974. This judgement seems to be broadly shared by the Bank of England, and liquidity problems have received little attention in representations from the CBI and indeed from industry generally.

As the outline of the Budget which the Chancellor gave the Prime Minister at the end of last week will have indicated, we are tending to the conclusion that there is little we can do on this occasion actually to help the company sector - all we can try to do is to avoid taking action which would add to the difficulties companies will be facing. Moreover there is relatively little in the fiscal field which will be of particular advantage to the manufacturing sector. The best possibility seems to be a reduction in the national insurance surcharge, but we may well find ourselves in the position that we could only afford this in 1980 if it were balanced by additional /taxation on the

From the Private Secretary
10 March 1980

Dear Mr.

The Prime Minister considered the Chancellor's minute of 5 March about the distributional effects of his proposed income tax package over the weekend, and also his minute of 7 March setting out his proposals in respect of capital taxation.

As I told you on the telephone, the Prime Minister is most concerned about the distributional implications of both sets of proposals. As regards income tax, she does not believe a package which will bear most heavily on those in the £21-£5,000 income bracket is tenable; for in her view, it would severely aggravate wage pressures in the next pay round.

For similar reasons, she believes it would be most unwise to make significant concessions on capital taxes this year. Even if the income tax package can be made more equitable, she thinks that even the relatively modest proposals put forward by the Chancellor will be widely criticised as favouring the rich at a time when the less well off are having to face higher prescription charges, charges for school transport, higher charges for school meals, etc. The Prime Minister therefore suggests that the Chancellor should drop his main proposals on CGT and CIT, and confine his proposals to the minor changes mentioned in paragraph 7 of his minute of 7 March.

The Prime Minister agrees that the stamp duty proposals should not be scorned as a capital tax measure, and she agrees with the proposal to raise the thresholds by £5000.

The Prime Minister would like to have an early discussion with the Chancellor. As I mentioned to you, she would find it helpful to have some clear figures on the distributional effects of both the Chancellor's preferred income tax package, and possible alternatives.",1980-03-10,10 Downing Street,"John Wiggins, Esq., HM Treasury",The Prime Minister's concerns about the distributional effects of the Chancellor's proposed income tax and capital taxation packages,Letter,PREM 19-176/0001/-89.jpg,"Prime Minister's Office, No. 10 Downing Street","The letter is addressed to the Prime Minister's Private Secretary, indicating that the Prime Minister is directly involved in the decision-making process regarding the proposed income tax and capital tax measures.

Of the other two proposals, the Prime Minister agreed with the proposal to increase from 10 to 20 per cent the annual value taken as the measure of the benefit of items such as suits and TV sets which are provided to employees by their employers. But she had doubts about the proposal to increase from 9 to 15 per cent the rate of interest by which the taxable benefit from an interest-free loan is measured. She was worried that the 15 per cent figure would give the impression that the Chancellor believed interest rates would stay as high as this; and if, as seemed likely, interest rates did begin to fall, a 15 per cent figure would seem inequitable. The Chancellor said that he would reconsider.

Stock Relief

The Prime Minister said that she had read the note explaining the ""dips"" scheme which the Chancellor enclosed with his minute of 12 March. She was still not entirely happy with the proposed scheme. In her view, it would be better to announce the end of the contingent liability and couple this with a smaller allowance for stock relief for this year. The ""dips"" scheme would in effect involve double deferment, and it would be expensive in terms of staff time. The Chancellor responded that the question of contingent liability and the extent of the allowance for stock relief were being looked at as part of the review of Corporation Tax, and this would not be completed for some time. In addition the company sector needed the immediate liquidity relief which the ""dips"" scheme would provide. The Prime Minister's proposal would not provide a viable alternative.

The Prime Minister said that she would accept the Chancellor's judgment on this.

Charities Package

The Chancellor explained the main elements in his proposed charities package. The Prime Minister said she was well content with them.

Indirect Taxes

The Chancellor and the Prime Minister did not discuss indirect taxes this morning. However, the Prime Minister is aware that the Chancellor has now gone firm on his preferred package, which was designated(vi) in his minute of 5 March. As you know, the Prime Minister commented on this package at their meeting last week; but she gave the Chancellor discretion to reach a final decision on this himself.",1978-03-15,T.P.

Further to our conversation of this morning, I enclose quotes which Peter Jenkin was prepared for the Chancellor about the current state of play on child benefit, including the amendment which Mr Jenkin expects will be put down to his current Social Security Bill at the Report Stage and the Scope for making changes at this stage to the Public Expenditure White Paper. The Chancellor thought that the Prime Minister might find this note useful.

Mr. Jenkin apparently intends to raise this matter at Cabinet on Thursday. The Chancellor had thought that a decision would have to made today about whether to remove from the Public Expenditure White Paper the current statement about the uprating of child benefit. In the event, however, officials have advised that the statement could be excised after Thursday's discussion, if that were to prove necessary. For obvious reasons, the Chancellor would strongly prefer it if this fact were not to be revealed before Cabinet.

I am grateful to you for a sight of the CRD report on the ORC survey of reactions to the June 1979 Budget (which I return).

Much of it is, of course, predictable. Indeed, I find most research very useful in supporting one's own judgments. However, research also tends to sharpen perceptions of what needs to be done next time round.

In this connection, the surveyhas led me to the following conclusions on the action needed this week:

(i) let us decide what is the main message and hammer it home on Budget Day and BD plus 1 in all broadcasts; is there one sentence encapsulating the overall purpose?

(ii) given the ability of people to swallow basic points put simply, we ought to prepare a list of positive bull points for one sheet of paper, perhaps with an intro which says that, whatever else Ministers do, they should get over the main one sentence message (point (i) above) and, where possible, hammer home the following subsidiary points:

(iii) we need to put over a few bull points which illustrate the essential fairness of the exercise; ""fairness"" comes through in the survey as one of the main plus/liability points;

INDUSTRY BILL

In the light of the agreement of E (EA) on 11 July to your proposals on the future role of the NEB, preparations will be going forward for the drafting of the Industry Bill. This will provide, among other things, new powers to dispose of NEB assets. As I understand it, the intention is to introduce the Bill directly after the Recess so that it could receive royal assent by January the latest. Obviously we do not want to jeopardise this timetable, but the Bill would provide an opportunity to seek powers to provide for certain other disposals on which we are relying to keep the PSBR in 1979-80 to 4% billion.

Some of these possibilities have already been mentioned at (EDL) or in correspondence. But I think it would be useful to bring them all together so that we can clarify, in the context of the forthcoming (EDL) discussions, just what would be practicable and what our priorities should be.

(EDL) Committee have not yet reached final views on the disposal of BNOC and BGC assets, but subject to the Committee's decisions, I think that there is a good case for including in the Industry Bill provisions to give the Secretary of State power to dispose of BGC and BNOC oil field assets in any way he might think fit. Such powers would be useful for disposals next year even if not required this.

I recognise that these powers could be included in the forthcoming Bill amending the Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Act 1975, but this Bill could well not be enacted in time for disposal to be made this financial year.

It was also suggested at the last meeting of (EDL) Committee that we should investigate further the sale of 49 per cent of the Government's holding in The Radio Chemical Centre (TRC). I am sure that the TRC is a good candidate for disposal this financial year, but I see no reason why the government should retain any holding at all in the Company. However, I understand the sale of all the shares would require legislation and I therefore suggest that, subject to David Howell's views, the relevant provision, which would be very short, should be included in the forthcoming Industry Bill.

Meanwhile preparations should be made for the sale of TRC so that the necessary legislation could be enacted before the end of the financial year.",1979-07-16,"Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street, SWIP 3AG","Secretary of State, Department of Industry, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, LONDON, SW1E 6RB",Industry Bill,Letter,PREM 19-31/0001/-38.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses planned disposals of NEB, BNOC, and BGC assets, and the potential inclusion of provisions related to these disposals in the upcoming Industry Bill.

Dear Nigel,

DISPOSALS OF LAND AND BUILDINGS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR

Thank you for your letter of 4 June proposing that Ministers concerned should carry out a quick review of the scope for selling land and buildings held by their Departments and subordinate agencies.

Since that letter, E(DL) Committee has asked me to report to them on this general subject, and my officials are in touch with others to put together a comprehensive paper, in the next week or so, setting out what is being done and what more needs to be done.

I am sure you will agree that in view of this there is no need for our colleagues to report separately at this stage in response to your letter. But of course the work needs to be pressed forward in Departments.

Dear Geoffrey,

Following recent comments about 
the probable sale of various equities held by the
Government, I would like to make a ""humble 
submission"" as to how this can be done at greater
advantage to the Exchequer.

A major equity sale generally
produces an anticipatory fall in the market and, even
then, the sale has to be made at a discount to the
price on the day of announcement (i.e. B.P. about 5%
in 1977). Should you offer a 10-year Bond
convertible into the equity, I would submit you would
get a 10-15% premium depending on coupon and, if
this form of sale was known in advance, anticipatory
selling would not be so great (+ 5% ?).

I would further suggest that the
convertible be available in Bearer form (like War
Loan) so that the coupon on the Bearer could be paid
free of tax, thus creating an avalanche of foreign
applications. This should cause no problems to the
Revenue as U.K. residents must hold their Bearer
stocks with authorised depositaries who are responsible
for withholding tax.",1979-05-23,MESSEL & CO,"The Rt. Hon.

Sale of New Town Assets

1. At yesterday afternoon's seminar on Monetary problems, the Prime Minister got on to the question of the sale of New Town assets as one way of reducing the need to sell energy assets.  She said that she would chase the matter herself but suggested that I, too, might have a look at it.  I have done some rapid ferreting this morning and the results may be of interest as background for the Prime Minister's own enquiries.

2. The assets under discussion are the commercial and industrial properties owned by the various 'New Towns'.  We are not talking about their residential property.  That is already being sold off reasonably rapidly to sitting tenants, but the point is that such sales do very little to help the PSBR because the Government has to lend the tenant the mortgage to finance the sale.

3. The amount of commercial and industrial property which could, in principle, be sold was first estimated at £2 bn.  This was a rapid initial estimate, undertaken not by the Department but by an outside consultant and he had insufficient data to work upon.  The true figure is much nearer £1bn.

4. The New Towns are, of course, major borrowers from the National Loans Fund (NLF).  For some time they have been financing part of their requirements for new development by selling off some of their existing commercial and industrial property to the sitting tenants.  Mr Heseltine's estimate of providing some £70m. of relief to the PSBR without legislation is his guess as to the extent to which he could 'twist the arms' of the New Towns.",N/A,SIR KENNETH BERRILL,MR LANKESTER,Sale of New Town Assets,letter,PREM 19-31/0001/-14.jpg,"Department for Levelling-up, Housing and Communities","The letter discusses the sale of commercial and industrial properties owned by New Towns, which falls under the remit of the Department for Levelling-up, Housing and Communities as it is responsible for policies related to housing and communities.",N/A

Dear David

I am extremely grateful for your letter of 23rd May on methods of sale of Government equity. You are of course right that I am concerned to ensure that the chosen method ensures the maximum advantage to the Exchequer, and I welcome the suggestions you have made in this context.

However you will also understand that I am extremely concerned that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement should be strictly controlled and in particular that my target of £8 billion for this financial year should be met, with further reductions (as a percentage of GDP) in the years which follow. An issue of convertible bonds along the lines you suggest would not, however, reduce the PSBR but could instead be a means of financing the PSBR. Thus the scheme would be open to many of the arguments against high public sector borrowing with which I am sure you are familiar.

I have also asked my officials to examine the question of the gain which might accrue to the Exchequer if your scheme was adopted rather than if there were a direct sale. They have advised me that, taking into account the cost of the interest paid on the bonds prior to conversion net of additional dividends received and any premium which might be obtained on the equity price, could go either way.

Disposal of Assets

The next meeting of E(DL) Committee, which the Prime Minister
will chair, has now been set for 1715 on Thursday 5 July. I have
asked the Prime Minister the points put forward by the Financial
Secretary in your letter of 27 June. She agrees that, in view
of the close link between the future of BNOC and the disposals
exercise generally, Mr. Howell's paper on the future of BNOC
should be taken by E(DL) - rather than by E(EA). She would be
grateful if Mr. Howell would proceed accordingly.

The Prime Minister also agrees that the Committee should
consider the option of BP purchasing all of BNOC's assets; and
for this purpose, she would like Mr. Howell to prepare a separate
paper dealing with this possibility.

The Prime Minister has asked that the Secretary of State
for Scotland should also attend the E(DL) meeting.

Dear Geoffrey,

Thank you for your letter of 7 June.

As I have said, I am anxious to do all I can to help you by one means or another. I must repeat that I can give you no categorical assurance on what can be done in 1979-80, and the figure of £200 must therefore remain your assumption.

Since writing my letter of 6 June, we have had Michael Eyers letter setting out the Law Officers' view that legislation would be required if disposals by BKC or BNOC are to be carried through by means of a direction on a basis which is legally sound. This opinion must reinforce caution about securing the proceeds of sales within 1979/80. But you can be sure we will do our best.

SALE OF PUBLIC SECTOR ASSETS

My letters of 15 May to you  and other Secretaries of State who sponsor major nationalised industries were mainly concerned with disposals in the current financial year, but also referred to disposals in later years. It would now be helpful if you could give me an up-to-date view of your plans or expectations for 1980/81 and later Years, on the assumption that £1 billion mentioned in the Budget Speech is realised in the current year on the lines the Chancellor has indicated.

I realise that in some cases no firm decisions or views have yet been taken, though I hope it will be possible to provide definite statements during July. Meanwhile I need to have your present views by this month. The reason is that the Chief Secretary will need to know roughly what sums we can count on for disposals in deciding what overall reductions in the inherited public expenditure plans he should propose to Cabinet early in July.

I should be grateful if your replies could cover the ground set out in the Annex for each nationalised industry or similar public corporation (including in the case of energy the AEA and its subsidiary companies), and if they could reach me by Friday 29 June at the latest or earlier if possible.

Dear Tim,

I understand that Sir Kenneth Berrill has suggested that there should be an examination of the possibility of disposing of the Sealink part of British Rail. This arose from Martin Hall's letter to you of 7 June about nationalised industries.

The attached note sets out some of the issues that would have to be examined in order to establish what would need to be done to make it possible to dispose of Sealink. But Mr Fowler is not convinced that it would be very useful to do any further work at the moment.

He has already made it clear (most recently in his letter of 29 June to the Financial Secretary) that he would not favour trying to sell off BR subsidiaries at this stage. In his view, the right line of policy is to seek ways to engage private capital in Sealink and some other parts of the British Rail group, as is proposed for BRC. To sell off particular subsidiaries (or even to suggest that the idea is under serious consideration) would run into considerable and certainly very expensive opposition from the unions and would not command the cooperation of the Railways Board, who would of course have to be involved in any further detailed study of the idea.

Industrial trouble on the railways as a result could quickly wipe out any potential profit from the sale. Mr Fowler will

The Prime Minister is interested in this subject, and has noted that present arrangements seem to act as a disincentive to hospitals in respect of the disposal of land. I understand that this is because the proceeds do not accrue to the hospital which held the land, but to the regional or district health authorities.

In respect of the BNOC situation although strictly speaking they are not legal points, I would agree with what you say in paragraph 3 (i) and (ii). Similarly I think the point you make in paragraph 3 (iii) is a valid one although obviously it is impossible to predict the effect of such a proposal.

Disposal of Public Sector Trading Assets

I understand that the Financial Secretary's memorandum on the disposal of public sector trading assets - ED(L)(792) - was considered in ED(L) Committee today. This paper discusses, amongst other things, the pros and cons of selling off assets abroad rather than in the United Kingdom. One disadvantage of selling abroad is the fact that foreign sales will not have any effect on the growth of the monetary aggregates, whereas domestic sales - provided they are not a substitute for sales of gilts - generally will.
This is a point which the Prime Minister has commented on, and I would be grateful if it could be taken into account in further Ministerial discussions.

SALE OF BRITISH SUGAR CORPORATION SHARES

Our correspondence about the sale of BSC shares rests with my
letter to you of 6 June but at last week's E(DL) meeting you
referred to your continuing preference for a later rather than
earlier sale of these shares.

I wonder if I could pursue this a little further. The point which
you earlier made about the principle effects of a further green pound
devaluation (and which I felt had some force) has now been met.
As you know it difficult to attach so much weight to your
other argument - relating to the BSC-Tate & Lyle situation - not least
in view of the powers which, even after a sale, would remain yours
under the Sugar Act 1956. However, this would not worry me unduly if
I could now be clear that it was your firm intention to sell the
shares some time in 1979-80. While there may be some scope for
adjusting the timing to fit with your discussion on the BSC-Tate and
Lyle situation within 1979-80, this sale is clearly included in the
arithmetic to which the Prime Minister's summing up referred. For
the avoidance of doubt I would be grateful if you could confirm that
you now judge it practicable to sell the shares in 1979-80.

DISPOSAL OF ASSETS OF BRITISH STEEL CORPORATION

I have seen a copy of the letter sent to you by the
Attorney General on 10th July 1979.

I would agree with what the Attorney says in relation to the
ability of BSC to sell its assets of its own volition.  I am not
however convinced that the agreement of the Corporation as a whole
would be necessary.  Schedule 1, paragraph 6, provides for the
Corporation to operate with a quorum to be determined by the
Corporation within the limits laid down by sub-paragraph (1).
Sub-paragraph (3) enables the Corporation otherwise to regulate its
own procedure, and unless it specifies that the disposal of assets
could only be effected with the agreement of the whole Corporation,
then the Corporation's normal voting procedures would apply.

I would however agree that in the political circumstances
prevailing it would be safer if all of the members of the Corporation
were in agreement with the proposed disposal so that there could be
no risk of a challenge to the decision which could result in litigation
(regardless of its likely outcome).

Without wearing you with the qualifications and problems, it seems certain that we can sell some government-owned land; and that we can secure further sales by new towns, regional water authorities etc reinforcing requests by constructing their borrowing. The total figure is uncertain, but it is very likely that we can achieve £10m, including £2m of defence surplus land, with a resultant PESC saving falling to Defence.

Dear Tim,

DISPOSAL OF PUBLIC SECTOR TRADING ASSETS

Thank you for your letter of 5 June. The Financial Secretary has very much in mind the different monetary effects of selling different types of asset, and in different ways. He will certainly ensure that the point is taken into account in future Ministerial discussions.

The greatest beneficial effect on the control of the money supply will be gained from sales of those types of asset which are not a close substitute for gilts and which are likely to be bought by domestic companies or institutions who do not normally hold significant quantities of public sector debt. Sales of interests in oil fields to UK oil companies would fall in this category. The benefit of domestic sales of BP shares is probably much less, because they will be taken up as a significant extent by Pension Funds and Life Offices, crowding out other purchases of equities or gilts. As you say, that benefit will in turn be somewhat greater than that from sales abroad, but not all that much. In deciding on the balance between domestic and external sales it will be necessary to balance the respective monetary effects against the prospective sale price and other factors.

I am sending copies of this letter to the private secretaries of the other members of E(DL), and to Martin Vile.

Yours,

Paule

FORESTRY COMMISSION

As you may be aware, I have been giving some thought recently in the context of the disposals exercise to the possibility of our selling off some of the Forestry Commission land.

The vast bulk of this land consists of the Commission's plantations which I accept we might well not wish to sell. However this still leaves a substantial remainder of unplanted land owned by the Commission. This will no doubt be covered by Michael Heseltine's exercise on surplus land but given the rather special characteristics of the Commission's land, and the particular problems and policy implications involved in selling it, I thought it right to ask you and the other Forestry Ministers (to whom I am copying this letter) for your views in advance of Thursday's E (DL) meeting.

The first requirement, it seems to me, is to establish in consultation with the Commission exactly how much unplanted land the Commission owns and how marketable it is. According to the Commission's last published accounts at 31 March 1978 it had 307,000 hectares of land in its plantable reserve and a further 67,000 hectares of other unplanted land. The value of all this land, plus the buildings on it was then assessed at nearly £75 million, of which ""surplus estate"" mainly agricultural and grazing land, accounted for about £10 million. These figures clearly need updating, and I should be surprised if, after recent land price rises, the total value of the Commission's estate (excluding the plantations) did not come up with a surplus estate value considerably higher than £10 million. It would be helpful if we could then estimate how much of this surplus estate we might realise and by a business like effort to dispose of it.

I recognise of course that it is already Forestry Commission policy to sell of its surplus estate. However the second proposal which I should like you to consider is somewhat more radical. This relates to the division between surplus and non-surplus land (including the miscellaneous land) and their valuation. One did not come up with a surplus estate value considerably higher than £10 million. It would be helpful if we could then estimate how much of this surplus estate we might realise and by a business like effort to dispose of it.

I recognise of course that it is already Forestry Commission policy to sell of its surplus estate. However the second proposal which I should like you to consider is somewhat more radical. This relates to the division between surplus and non-surplus land (including the miscellaneous land) and their valuation. One could argue that the distinction between surplus and non-surplus is quite artificial and that we should look at the Forestry Commission's entire land holding, decide what land we really need to retain for forestry purposes, and then dispose of the rest, surplus or not, at the best price we can get. This would involve a major review of the Forestry Commission's land holdings, but I believe it is a review which is overdue and which could yield significant returns. The resources thereby generated could then be used to improve and expand the Commission's forestry activities in line with government policies.",1979-07-16,Forestry Commission,"Minister of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food",Disposing of some of the Forestry Commission land,letter,PREM 19-31/0001/-46.jpg,"Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","The letter discusses the Forestry Commission's land holdings, which falls under the remit of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as they are responsible for forestry policy in the UK.",1979-08-13

Dear Tim,

DISPOSAL OF NEW TOWN ASSETS

In your letter of 18 May reporting the Prime Minister's conversation with Mr. Gordon Pepper, you mentioned, inter alia, Mr. Pepper's ideas for the disposal of new town industrial and commercial assets and the idea of a disposals organisation. This letter is simply to record that the point has certainly not been overlooked (we regard the monetary base idea as sub judice).

2. For 1979-80, the Secretary of State for the Environment offered £20 million towards the disposal of new town assets and this was taken into account in the Budget arithmetic. £20 million was thought to be the maximum that could be offered within the limitations of existing legislation, which permit the proceeds from the disposal of new town assets to be used only for the benefit of the new town which has disposed of them.

3. For the longer term, new town industrial and commercial assets will be dealt with by EDC (Estates Disposal Committee) in the course of their survey of the prospects for disposal of public sector land and buildings. The question of new legislation will be covered in the same context, as will the case for a disposals organisation.

"These first reviews will no doubt show that there are a number of general policy areas which we shall need to consider.  Some questions which occur to me are:

(i) Can we ensure that sales of surplus property give benefit to the PSBR, instead of encouraging expenditure in other directions, but avoid reducing the incentive for departments and public sector authorities to sell in the first place?

(ii) Can the disposal of surplus property be speeded up by streamlining local authority planning procedures?

(iii) What measures, including legislation, are needed to secure the sale of land and buildings owned by new town corporations on a significant scale to the benefit of the PSBR?

(iv) What can be done to encourage or require local authorities to dispose of investment property such as factories, city centre sites etc.?

(v) Would it be desirable to establish a special organisation to ensure that surplus property in the public sector is disposed of in an orderly, prompt and efficient manner?

Dear Chancellor of the Exchequer,

FINANCING OF BRITISH AIRWAYS

At E(DL) last Thursday there was a general welcome for my proposal for reconstituting British Airways within the framework of the Companies Acts. This would provide the basis for a sale of part of the equity to the private sector. The revenue thus raised will be a useful contribution to our programme for the disposal of public assets but this proposal will also provide the basis for removing the airline's investment programme of nearly £1 billion over the next five years from the public sector borrowing requirement. It was agreed that the necessary provisions should be included in the Civil Aviation Bill already planned for the present Session. There are strong reasons why I should make an early announcement of our intentions in general terms:

a) In order to take the plan forward, and to frame the legislation, we need to put in hand detailed discussions with a wider group of people in British Airways than the handful of the most senior Board members who have so far been involved. It would be impossible tocarry out this work and at the same time maintain the very high degree

PRIME MINISTER

Financing of British Airways - Share Issue
(E(DL)(79) 4)

BACKGROUND
This paper was in preparation before the present meeting was arranged.

It has been put on this agenda because the Secretary of State for Trade suggested to you that disposal of part of British Airways would be an accepdata alternative to the sale of BP shares. This proposition proves doubtful on examination. As my main brief explains, there is little chance of legislation in the present Session, at least in time to effect a sale in 1979-80. If this is confirmed the proposals in the paper need not be pursued at the present meeting. There is also a question mark over the treatment of the figures: the particular solution recommended by Mr. Nott might not actually reduce the borrowing requirement (though it would help to finance it). You need not get drawn into this technical argument if there is no prospect of legislation in time.

HANDLING
2. I suggest you start the discussion yourself on these lines, and then ask the Secretary of State for Trade to introduce his paper, as briefly as possible.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer may wish to reply. You might aim to steer the Sub-Committee away from any more substantive discussion, remitting detailed study of these proposals to a further meeting of E(DL) under the Chancellor of the Exchequer later.

CONCLUSIONS
3. You might leave these to the end of the meeting: but they will probably be that this proposal cannot score in the present year, and that the detailed suggestions should be examined more closely by the Sub-Committee before decisions are taken.

Dear Financial Secretary,

SALE OF PUBLIC SECTOR ASSETS

The timing of the request in your letter of 19 June that I should estimate the proceeds in 1980/81 and later years from disposals by the nationalised industries which I sponsor leaves me in difficulty, for a definitive reply would seem to pre-empt the consideration of the scope for disposals and ""privatisation"" which is being pursued by the group of Ministers under Keith Joseph's Chairmanship.

My industries are the two Scottish Electricity Boards and the Scottish Transport Group. I cannot reasonably adopt a policy towards them which differs markedly from that adopted by David Howell and Norman Fowler towards the similar industries in England and Wales. There may also be considerations of Scottish policy which they would wish me to take into account.

For these reasons, I cannot at this stage offer the definitive answers which you seek. The best I can do is indicate that there may be scope for the selling off by the Electricity Boards of some retailing and servicing activities (this may be limited, in parts of the North of Scotland, by the absence of a market on a scale sufficient to attract a private entrepreneur); and, in STG's case, for realising various minor ancillary interests.

I cannot however estimate the amounts involved, far less allocate them to specific years, without consultation with the industries which I am not yet ready to undertake. I do not, in any event, suppose that the sums are likely to be of an order which would have an appreciable effect on the Chancellor's public expenditure arithmetic.

Dear Keith,

DISPOSAL OF ASSETS BY BRITISH STEEL CORPORATION

I have seen the Lord Advocate's letter to you of 12 July.

In fact there is no disagreement between us.  In referring
to a sale with the agreement of the BSC Board ""as a whole""
(paragraph 4 of my letter to you of 10 July) I meant the BSC Board
acting as a Board, that is in accordance with the voting procedure
which applies to the transaction in question;  certainly it is not
a legal requirement, unless the Board's own rules of procedure
say so, for every member of the Board to signify agreement to a
sale of assets and for this to be recorded in the Board's minutes.
But I agree with the Lord Advocate that in the present circumstances it would be desirable for the Board to act, and to be
recorded as acting, unanimously through all its members.

This is copied to all the recipients of the Lord Advocate's

Dear Peter,

MARKET TOWERS

At E(DL) on 5 July I undertook to write to you
about the proposed sale of the office building called
Market Towers at Nine Elms, owned by the Covent Garden
Market Authority. This is referred to in Nigel Lawson's
Memorandum of 2 July to E(DL), under reference 79/66, at
paragraph 21(ii)(a) and at paragraph 6 in Annex A to that
document.

2. Under the Covent Garden Market Act 1961, which has been
amended since that date to take account of the removal of
the Market from the Covent Garden to Nine Elms, the CGMA
has the statutory duty, amongst other duties, of managing
the Market. Under section 18(2) of the 1961 Act (since
amended but not in a way that affects this advice) the CGMA
has a supplemental power to dispose of any property or
rights ""not in their opinion required for the proper
exercise or performance of their functions"" so long as
the disposal is, also in their opinion, ""calculated to
facilitate the proper discharge of their duties ... or is
incidental or conducive thereto"".

3. According to Nigel Lawson's Memorandum, the retention
of Market Towers ""is not necessary to the functioning of
the Market"". If this is genuinely the case, and this would
have to be the opinion of at least a voting majority of
the members of the CGMA, then I am prepared to advise that
the CGMA can sell the building under section 18(2) of the
1961 Act and that the sale would be valid. This is subject
to the caveat in 5 below.",1979-07-10,Royal Courts of Justice,Peter,Proposed sale of the office building called Market Towers,Letter,PREM 19-31/0001/-68.jpg,Department for Business and Trade,"The proposed sale of the office building called Market Towers at Nine Elms is related to the management of the Covent Garden Market, which falls under the remit of the Department for Business and Trade as it supports businesses and growth in the UK.",1979-08-07

mid-1981 (thus allowing the offer to be made on the basis of the
1980 trading results). On the assumption that the Corporation
continue to improve their trading performance between now and
then, the market valuation of the equity at that stage might
be of the order of £50m. Against this we should make allowance
for the deficiency in the pension funds;~possibly £25m. So
for the present exercise I suggest that you assume £35m in 1981/82.

REVIEW OF QUANGOS

Your letter of 17th May referred to the Cabinet's decision that Ministers should submit reports on the ""quangos"" for which they are responsible by 7th June. This letter deals with
nationalised industries (category (a) in your letter), apart from BNOC (which the Department of Energy will cover in a reply) in which the Chancellor's responsibility for policy on nationalised industries. It also covers BP and certain of the commercial companies in which Government has a shareholding. Other bodies in this latter category will be dealt with in sponsoring Ministers' replies. I shall be writing to you separately about ""Treasury Quangos"" such as NEDC.

A reduction of nationalised industries and other quangos, as defined in your letter, will of course be achieved by the decision the Government has already taken in the context of the Budget to raise revenue from disposals in the current year. This will involve, among other things, a reduction in the Government's shareholding in BP and in the NEB's shareholding in manufacturing industry.

Further reductions of the public sector will be achieved by disposals in the longer term. Ministers will be discussing Sir Keith Joseph's paper on nationalised industry policy including general policy questions on disposals on 21st June and the Cabinet has commissioned a review of the options for disposals after the current financial year of shares in nationalised industries and other public corporations or of their assets including land.

DISPOSAL OF ASSETS

Thank you for your letter of 6th June.

I am writing to let you know that in view of what you have said to me during the week and of your exchange with the Prime Minister yesterday, including her view that BNOC must certainly be slimmed down (recorded in her Private Secretary's letter to yours of 6th June), I have finalised the Budget arithmetic on the assumption that you will be able to realise at least £200 million from sales of BNOC's assets and of BOC's oil interests during the current year. (I was glad to see that you made it absolutely clear to Sir Denis Rooke that no assurance could be given to him on the question of disposals of assets.) As we agreed, the passage on disposals will not mention either corporation by name but will speak of ""...... sales of other public sector assets"".

I have also taken credit for £100 million for the cash flow effect of taking oil royalties in kind on the assumption that you will announce this as soon as possible after the Budget. I also assume that this will not be unwound during 1980/81, unless there is a major change in the oil supply situation. I understand that our officials have now concluded that the originally agreed figure of £100 million is the right one.

I have taken credit too for the effect on the PSBR of Sir Denis Rooke's offer to raise his debt repayment and change his cash limit accordingly. I am however concerned that BGC can almost overnight find further savings of £132 million. I hope that this is something we can ensure will not happen again next year.

Dear Geoffrey,

When the disposal of public sector assets was discussed at last Thursday's Cabinet, Michael Heseltine made the point that it was important to try to involve the employees in our plans.

I fully agree with Michael that we must aim to take employees along with us as far as we can. This is particularly relevant to the National Freight Corporation. There is inside the Corporation considerable support for our plan for a BP type solution as set out in the Manifesto and 'The Right Track'. But we should recognise that plans to break up the business by selling off individual parts would be bitterly opposed. I would not want to rule this out as a last resort. We might have to come to it if nothing better emerges.

Dear Mr Edmonds,

E(DL) MEETING, THURSDAY 5 JULY

This is just to confirm the conversation we had earlier today on the telephone, when I suggested that any proposals your Secretary of State may have for further sales of property or land in the current year might usefully be brought forward for discussion at next Thursday's meeting of E(DL). As I explained, the Financial Secretary's paper (which is being circulated this afternoon) starts from Tim Lankester's letter of 25 June and is intended to be a comprehensive reassessment of the options for sales of assets in the current year. It is highly desirable that all such options should have been tabulated before Thursday's meeting, so that the Committee can make their decisions fully briefed. Should your Secretary of State have any further proposals to make, therefore, whether covering new towns or land disposals generally, the Financial Secretary would be grateful if he would circulate a paper before the meeting or, alternatively, since time is short, if a would write to members of the Committee in advance.

I am copying this letter to secretaries of the other members of E(DL), and to Tim Lankester (since the Prime Minister will be chairing E(DL) on Thursday) and Sir John Hunt.

I have read with interest your letter of 16 July to Peter Walker.

You seem to be suggesting a quite fundamental change in the role of the Forestry Commission, and possibly in our approach to forestry policy in the periphery of the Disposals Exercise.   I am reluctant to take any view on these issues without having before me a full examination of their implications, and proper time for consideration.   I would not object to our deciding to consider with the Commission whether there is scope for disposal of rather more of the land which they hold, without commitment to the scale of disposal or of changes in basic policy.

Dear Mike,

DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS LAND IN THE NHS ESTATE

You asked for comments on the points raised by the Prime Minister on the present arrangements for disposal of land owned by the National Health Service.

My Secretary of State fully shares the Prime Minister's view that the procedures must provide an adequate incentive to dispose of surplus land and this means that those concerned locally must share in the proceeds. As you will see from the attached note which sets out current practice in more detail, there are already moves in this direction but the Secretary of State has made it clear that he expects to see proposals for making much faster progress in this area within the current review.

Yours sincerely

D Brereton

SALE OF ASSETS BY MEANS OF CONVERTIBLE STOCKS

The Chancellor has asked for advice on a suggestion, made to him in a letter (attached) from Mr Hunter of I Messel and Co, dated 23 May, that there would be an advantage to the Exchequer in selling Government equity holdings by issuing a 10 year gilt convertible into the equity at a later date. The Financial Secretary has also asked about schemes of this sort (Mrs Diggle's minute of 29 May).

2. A point to note immediately about such a scheme is that sale of convertible gilts for this purpose would not in itself cause a reduction in the PSBR, but rather would count as a financing transaction. The PSBR would only be reduced (assuming, as with BP, that the equity sale itself did constitute a PSBR reduction) when the shares were actually handed over.* Thus although the monetary effects of a scheme of this sort would be very little different from those of an immediate sale of the shares the PSBR effect would be delayed until the option to convert was exercised.

3. A claim made for the issue of convertible gilts is that the shares (or the gilts) could be sold at a premium rather than at a discount in the case of direct sale of the shares. But in fact this is only likely to be true if convertibility is optional. In this case there is a chance that the investor will make a capital gain because the share price might rise above the option price, whereas if the share price fell the option to buy need not be exercised. Thus the investors would have a one-way option for which they would probably be prepared to pay. But an implication of this is that if the share price did fall the sale of shares might never occur.

4. If the conversion into shares were made compulsory within a certain period, the effect on the price obtainable by the Government is less clear cut and although a premium might be obtained this would be far less than with optional convertibility.",1979-06-01,MR BRIDGEMAN,"cc Sir D Airey, Mr Little, Mr F Jones, Miss Brown, Mr Lavelle, Mr Monck, Mr R G Ward, Mr Wicks, Mr Williams, Mr Bell, Chief Cashier, Mr George",Sale of assets by means of convertible stocks,Letter,PREM 19-31/0001/-128.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses a suggestion made to the Chancellor regarding the sale of government equity holdings by issuing convertible gilts.

In view of this, my Secretary of State would like the Minister of State, Adam Butler, to make the statement on Shipbuilding.

FORESTRY LAND

You asked for preliminary views on the proposals for selling
Forestry Commission land contained in your letter of 16 July to
Peter Walker.

Your letter raises a number of important points but I do not think we
should ignore the fact that the Commission already has an active sales
policy of selling off ""surplus"" land which brings an annual income in
excess of £1 million. I am quite happy that your proposal be considered
carefully but I suspect that closer examination will suggest that it
will not be as easy to realise the sums mentioned in your letter as
you suggest.

First, much of the land in Scotland is in remote areas, is tenanted
or of comparatively poor quality. It may not prove attractive to the
private sector. Second, I doubt whether the private sector could
readily absorb land at the rate implied by the annual receipts figure
quoted in your letter. Third, insofar as the sale of land acquired
for Forestry is concerned, an amendment to the Forestry Act would be
required and this would not be a popular Bill.

I must add that I attach considerable importance to the social role
performed by the Forestry Commission in, for example, providing employment
in the Highlands. I would be less than enthusiastic about too great
or too fast a shift from public to private sector forestry if this meant
a dramatic reduction in employment in the remote parts of Scotland.
At the same time there are areas where I am inclined to prefer the suggestion made
to the Chief Secretary by Peter Walker that the Forestry Commission
might operate a revolving fund by selling off afforested land at
some stage before maturity. This clearly needs more study and also
involves legislation. On your last point, I understand that the
Forestry Commission are not likely to break even until the end of the
century and this is dependent largely on physical constraints such as
tree species, growth rates and location - assuming that cost/price
relationships remain about the same.",1979-07-18,Scottish Office,"Nigel Lawson Esq MP, Financial Secretary to the Treasury",Forestry land,Letter,PREM 19-31/0001/-30.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses proposals for selling Forestry Commission land, which falls under the remit of the Treasury as it involves government assets and revenue.",1979-08-15

FINANCING OF BRITISH AIRWAYS

In your letter of 13 July to the Chancellor, you sought your colleagues' agreement to the text of a statement about the future financing of British Airways, to be made if possible on Wednesday 18 July.  I am writing quickly to say that I do see some difficulties of principle with the text of the statement as now drafted, which I think we should probably try to resolve at E(DL) on Thursday 19 July.  The points which concern me are summarised in paragraph 11 of my paper about Disposals in 1980-81 (E(DL)(79)9), which will be on the agenda at that meeting.

Essentially the point at issue concerns whether or not the Government's future relationship with British Airways will be such as to warrant the airline's being regarded as part of the private sector.  In this and the other cases where we are contemplating the 'BP solution', we have to make up our minds whether the Government is standing back from continued effective support and control or not.  If we are willing to give up all control over British Airways (and incidentally to refrain from appointing a majority of the directors), then we shall have substituted the disciplines of the markets for the regime of financial targets and cash limits which characterises the non-privatised nationalised industries; and we can regard British Airways as part of the private sector. But if we continue to give British Airways the sort of support you are contemplating at the beginning of your letter, then we shall have to regard it as being still within the public sector.",1979-07-18,"Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street, SWIP 3AG","The Rt Hon John Nott MP, Secretary of State for Trade, Department of Trade, 1 Victoria Street, LONDON, SW1",FINANCING OF BRITISH AIRWAYS,letter,PREM 19-31/0001/-33.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses the financing of British Airways, which is a matter of economic and financial policy that falls within the remit of HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry.",1979-08-15

Dear Tom,

Disposal of Assests

The Prime Minister has considered the Chancellor of the Exchequer's minute of 22 June on the above subject, and I understand she spoke with the Chancellor about it over the weekend.

The Prime Minister does not dispute that ""some £1 billion"" of asset sales have to be found during this financial year. However, she is concerned about the timing and extent of the proposed sale of BP shares. In view of the state of the oil market at present, she believes it would be most unwise to go ahead with preparations for the BP sale in July. In addition, she feels that a further effort should be made to find alternative assets for disposal so that the number of BP shares to be sold can be kept to a minimum.

Accordingly, the Prime Minister has asked that no further moves should be taken on the sale of the BP shares until she has returned from Tokyo. She would then like to take the chair at a meeting of E(DL) committee to consider the question of timing and possible alternative sales further.

I am sending copies of this letter to Private Secretaries to members of the Cabinet including the Minister of Transport, the Attorney General, the Lord Advocate and Sir John Hunt.",1979-06-25,From the Private Secretary,Dear Tom,Disposal of Assests,Letter,PREM 19-31/0001/-113.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses the disposal of assets, which falls under the remit of the HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry responsible for managing public spending and economic policy.",1979-07-23

Dear Nott

FINANCING OF BRITISH AIRWAYS

I have seen your letter of 12 July to Geoffrey Howe, to which
you attached a draft statement on the financing of British
Airways. As you know, a comparable statement on British Aerospace
will be made next week, and there is a possibility of the two
being closely compared. While I in general see no difficulty
about your statement, there are two points where I should be
grateful if some change might be made.

The first arises from your reference to employee shares, which
is couched in terms of your preference for offering shares on
favourable terms. I wonder whether you would consider a slight
redrafting, to reflect both the Government's determination to
see some special arrangements for employees, without suggesting
however that these will necessarily be at a preferred price,
which may not be easy to arrange. I have in mind something on
the lines of ""Special arrangements will be made to allow
employees of British Airways to take up shares in the new company
so that they can participate in its future and share in its
growth."" If you are content with this formulation, I should use
a similar phrase in my own statement on British Aerospace.

The second point arises in relation to your description of
consultations. As you know from my letter of 5 July, I am
consulting directly with the trade unions involved in British
Aerospace on our policy. I do not believe that this, a matter
of Government policy, is principally a subject for consultation
for the British Aerospace Board; nor that consultation on this
cuts across the proper relations between Board and trade unions
on those questions which are for the Corporation. I should
therefore be unhappy if your statement were to say, as the present
draft does, that your directly analogous consultations are
princiPally a matter for the British Airways Board. I should
very much prefer, therefore, for your sixth point to read simply:
""Sixth, I envisage the fullest possible process of consultation
with the airline's management and employees. I will be glad to
meet representatives of the trade unions concerned.""

I am copying this to those who received copies of your letter.

Dear Tim,

DISPOSAL OF ASSETS

The Financial Secretary has seen your letter of 25 June to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Private Secretary in which you report that the Prime Minister would like to take the chair at a meeting of E(DL) Committee to consider the question of timing of the sale of BP shares and possible alternative sales.

In the light of this the Financial Secretary is preparing a paper on disposals generally for discussion by E(DL) next week; the paper will discuss a BP sale and other disposals which might be possible this year.

One such possibility is the disposal of BNOC assets - following the Chancellor's letter to the Secretary of State for Energy of 11 June, at least £200m is contemplated from this source as a contribution towards the £lbn mentioned in the Budget speech. The disposal of BNOC assets is, of course, intimately connected with Government's future plans for BNOC, on which I understand that the Secretary of State for Energy plans to submit a paper to E(EA) Committee next week, probably Tuesday or Wednesday. The Financial Secretary thinks that in view of the close link between the future of BNOC and the disposals exercises generally, it would be helpful if the Secretary of State tabled his paper to E(DL), rather than to E(EA). This would give Ministers the opportunity to consider the two subjects together, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, and to come to a considered judgement on both.",1979-06-27,"Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street, SWIP 3AG","T Lankester Esq

Dear Chancellor,

I am sorry I was absent for the meeting on dis-
posals on 20 June, but I must express my concern
on reading the minutes. I do feel that with the
present energy crisis we must not be seen to be
making disposals that can be interpreted as being
impetuous or as giving foreigners a bigger stake
in our oil.

I also think that it is vital for public opinion
at home, that on all disposals we have a clear
and impressive programme involving employee part-
icipation in shareholdings.

I presume that before any scheme for the disposal
of BP shares is announced publicly the Cabinet
will have an opportunity of giving its views on
these vital political implications.

Dear Geoffrey,

IS PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SELF-INDEXING?
- And does it matter if it is?

You will remember that we referred, in the table of contents for the ""Long Campaign"" paper (now in the process of serialisation, as agreed!) to the ""auto-indexing muddle"". We have done some more thinking about this and have the suspicion - I wouldn't put it stronger than that - that public expenditure is effectively self-indexing to such an extent as to threaten quite seriously the achievement of the financial strategy.

Accordingly, we have tried to set down our thinking in the attached paper. I would stress that we don't pretend to know the answer to the questions posed by the paper; we are really not qualified to do that. The paper therefore simply raises the underlying questions and tries to explain why we are worrying about them. If we are sounding a false alarm, then there is no harm done. If there is anything in what we say, then, with so much at stake, the problem needs further thought by those properly qualified to tackle it.

Indexation, whether as a policy or as a phenomenon, is a very elusive subject as we found working in Sir Douglas Wass' small group last winter. I think most of us got fairly confused at various stages during that exercise. It is this elusiveness which makes it such a treacherous ground, hence our concern and hence the paper.

Public Expenditure, EFLs, etc.

1. As the Prime Minister knows, I am convinced that a high exchange rate, and high interest rates which in part cause it, are a combined burden which important sectors of manufacturing industry cannot endure for long on top of the other difficulties they currently face.

2. The Chancellor is putting forward proposals which are intended to create conditions in which interest rates and hence the exchange rate can fall. As I understand it, these include:

(i) the public expenditure savings in the Chief Secretary's paper (£1.85 bn.);
(ii) the cuts in EFLs proposed in E(80)121;
(iii) further PSBR savings of £24 bn., presumably from taxation.

However, it is not clear so far what the consequences of this package would be for industry and employment.

3. On the one hand these proposals should achieve a significant reduction in the PSBR, and therefore in interest rates and the exchange rate with consequent benefits to industry. But against this must be set the direct effects of a cutback in public programmes much of which will fall on investment and hence the manufacturing industry, together with the effects of a reduction in real personal disposable income which also will affect industry adversely. I believe it is essential that Ministers should have, before Cabinet on 30 October, a quantified assessment from the Chancellor of the likely net consequences for industry and employment of his proposals.

4. I do not know how reassuring such an assessment will be. However, if there is still a substantial risk of continuing serious damage to important sectors I believe the Chancellor should also provide, at least, ...

Dear Chief Secretary,

In case I am not able to attend Cabinet on Thursday I thought it would be helpful if I recorded my reactions to your proposals in C(80)40 so far as their effect on education is concerned. I concentrate, as you do, on 1981-82.

2. Your proposals would mean substantial further reductions in the education programme over and above those we agreed earlier this year. The maximum possible that could be made without reducing the quality of the service. I would like to explain why I do not consider that we should make the further reductions.

i. Your figure of £87m, including the savings to offset the school transport loss, is a good deal more than the total shown in the PESC Report for the three items that you identify in paragraph 18, namely capital expenditure, higher education (including the consequential savings on student awards) and a reduction in the school leaving age.

THE RATE SUPPORT GRANT ORDERS

Thank you for your letter of 3 October about the timetable for decisions leading up to this autumn's
RSG settlement.  As you know, I myself have felt for some time that it would be wrong to reach decisions
on RSG in isolation from other public expenditure decisions.   I am therefore content with your proposal
that Cabinet should consider the settlement package on 30 October rather than 23 October as you originally
suggested.   I take note of what you say about the consequences for the timing of subsequent events, and
do, of course, sympathise with your desire to get the RSG debate in before Christmas if possible.  I agree
with you that it would be sensible to await passage of
the Local Government Bill before announcing the
dettefment of the settlement date.

Copies of this letter go to the recipients of yours.

Dear Secretary of State,

We agreed at Cabinet on 16 July that I should let you know if I could find
the resources of additional civil defence measures from within my existing
programmes. The additional costs in Scotland would be:

Civil defence
                   1980-81  1981-82  1982-83  1983-84

Additional requirement for
optimum provision            0.6       0.9      1.0

As you know, John Biffen has proposed that there should be a very substantial
reduction in Scottish expenditure in addition to the reductions which all
other Departments are facing. I cannot agree to the full amount he has
requested but I am prepared to make a significant reduction. It will be
extremely difficult to accommodate in my programmes and I have not yet
decided where the cuts might fall once the size of the reduction has been
settled, but I am sure you will understand that it is placing me in an
extremely serious situation. In the circumstances I have no option at this
stage but to say that I cannot undertake to find even the modest sums that
our new civil defence measures will require.

As you know I am a strong supporter of what you wish to do for Civil Defence
and it distresses me not to be able to help as I would certainly have done in
more normal circumstances.

"the Survey period.  To forego any Defence reductions might be to concede rather more than this, since it would be difficult to secure Cabinet agreement to the total public expenditure cuts sought if as significant a programme as Defence had been wholly exempted.   On the other side of the equation, the proceeds from a sale in November of 50 per cent of the shares in Bae Ltd. are, on the DOI's estimate, likely to amount to rather less than £70 million; and, provided that no new launch aid proposals from the Company were accepted, the £3Bm would additionally benefit to the tune of some £100 million in 1981-82 and £75 million in the following two years as a result of the Company's meeting its forecast capital requirements from within the private sector.  The imbalance in these figures is obvious: moreover, it is not certain that a sale of shares next month could take place even if MOD were granted exemption from any Survey reduction, since their current cash limit problems would make it difficult for them to give a commitment to no cancellation of existing BAe orders.

Dear John,

Thank you for sending me a copy of your minute of 8 July to the Prime Minister about end-year flexibility.

Like you, I support the proposed scheme; but, also like you, I have some doubts about our ability to introduce it this year if it would have the impact on total spending next year which you expect. I am, however, puzzled by the statement in paragraph 13 of the note by the Treasury that ""it would be unwise to assume that the whole of the amount carried forward into the year 1981-82 if the scheme were introduced this year"" will be matched by extra underspending"". Since the present general allowance for shortfalls next year is only just over 1 per cent of total planned expenditure, a low figure even by comparison with this year let alone earlier years, it seems to me likely that any sums carried forward into 1981-82 under the scheme will be fully matched by sums similarly carried forward into 1982-83.

In short, as I implied in paragraph 3 of my letter to you of 8 July, I doubt whether we need to retain the contingency reserve for 1981-82 at its present level simply to accommodate the introduction of the new scheme this year.

I am sending copies of this letter to the Prime Minister, the other members of the Cabinet, Norman Fowler, Sir Robert Armstrong and Sir Derek Rayner.

Dear Minister,

At Cabinet on 10 July I was asked to put round a
paper on the options for further measures of industrial
support. This reflected the concern of yourself
(amongst others) that we should be as inventive as
the situation allows about the means of stimulating
economic renewal at a time of recession.

I shall be considering this carefully. I know that
you have put forward a number of suggestions which we
have felt able to adopt. But I think the record
of our first year of office is quite respectable. We
have had a generally favourable reaction to the enterprise
elements in the 1980 Budget, especially the Venture
Capital scheme, the small workshops scheme and Enterprise
Zones. And work is in hand on measures which would
maintain this thrust. While we certainly need to keep
up the momentum, I do not think we need to be shamefaced
about progress so far.

The overall expenditure constraint is of course severe,
but I do not intend to rule out proposals to stimulate
enterprise simply on financial grounds: there may be
a case for some rearrangement of priorities for expenditure.
Ideas which do not involve substantial expenditure
will naturally be easier to accommodate and if you have
further suggestions I should of course be glad to have
them.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY 1980: SCOTLAND

1.	In C(80)40, the Chief Secretary proposes that my pro-grammes (excluding agriculture and fisheries) should be reduced by £15.0m a year over the next three years. This reduction would be additional to those flowing from his specific proposals on health, education, etc. I was given no warning, formal or informal, of this proposal which purports to reflect the outcome of a meeting of Ministers on 1 May held to consider the Needs Assessment Study com-pleted last year.

2.	In fact, as the note of that meeting records, there was general agreement that it would be very difficult politically to alter relative shares by re-distributing existing public expenditure allocations, particularly since any such re-distribution would have to be made public. We did, however, agree that it would be legitimate to take account of the results of the Needs Assessment Study as a relevant factor in taking decisions on the distribution of increases or reductions in public expenditure plans. In taking this decision the Ministers concerned were all aware that the great bulk of my expenditure is, in total, adjusted in proportion to changes in the total of comparable programmes in England and Wales. The formula by which this is done was made public with Treasury agreement at the same time as the last Public Expenditure White Paper: and, as it happens, I was questioned in detail about this by the Scottish Select Committee yesterday.

3.	The needs Assessment Study was part of the ill-fated devolution proposals which assumed an arm's length relation-ship between the UK Government and a Scottish Assembly. Many of us, in resisting the Assembly, argued that Scotland would do less well financially if it had one. The Chief Secretary's proposal totally undermines this argument - and this on the basis of a Study which the Chief Secretary himself acknowledges was not intended to determine relative levels of public expenditure. As you said in the House last week it is right that public expenditure per head in Scotland is greater by a considerable amount than in England and Wales.",1980-01-01,Scottish Office,Prime Minister,Public Expenditure Survey 1980: Scotland,Letter,PREM 19-167/0001/-191.jpg,Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland,"The letter discusses proposed reductions in public expenditure for Scotland, which falls under the remit of the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland.

Thank you for your letter of 19 September. We are, of course, discussing this on 29 September.

The already agreed expenditure reductions for DOE programmes over the planning period illustrate our particular problem. DOE is already contributing some £24m in expenditure reductions over the period 1978/79 to 1982/83. This is roughly equal to the reduction planned over that period for the whole of UK public expenditure. I have already contributed greatly more than a proportionate share to the public expenditure reductions we have so far made.

Following the July decisions, I have completed a further review of DOE programmes. I propose to achieve the further savings you required as follows:

	1981/82	1982/83	1983/84

Housing	14	40	35
DOE (other)	42	56	31
PSA	9	5	5
	65	81	71

On the DOE (other) programmes the two major items are water investment and Local Environmental Services. On the former, I have now reduced the programme to a minimum barely consistent with maintaining the service and keeping pace with new developments of housing and industry. On the latter, expenditure is now declining in line with the reductions in total local authority expenditure, and should continue to do so over the period. But it would be unrealistic to think that we could impose a substantially faster decline.

The PSA has already taken severe cuts and is now down nearly to its minimum base-load of virtually fixed costs (rents of Government offices and other property, essential services to buildings and basic maintenance). There is very little left for new developments, although some of those have a very high priority with colleagues. I am nevertheless seeing what further reductions can be made in current expenditure. I am also proposing the deletion of expenditure on the Inland Revenue Computerisation of PAYE scheme (where there is no firm commitment.)

DEBATE ON THE RATE SUPPORT GRANT ORDERS

You will see from the enclosed copy of my letter to Geoffrey Howe that we are faced with the unavoidable prospect of slippage in the rate support grant timetable this autumn.

It is in practice now certain, though I do not propose to announce this yet, that the date of the Rate Support Grant Settlement will have to be put back by one week from 21 to 28 November. This means a tight timetable if the Report on the 1981-82 RSG settlement (under the new block grant system) and the Reports and Increase Orders to update the 1979-80 and 1980-81 settlements (under the existing legislation) are to be tabled and debated before the House rises for the Christmas adjournment.

Last time, for various reasons, (including the withdrawal of the first Local Government Bill) it was not possible to hold the annual RSG debate until January 1980. This was criticised as unsatisfactory, especially for the local authorities who needed to know their exact entitlements before deciding on their 1980-81 rates or precepts, and I am anxious that the same does not happen again when we are in the throes of introducing block grant.

Authorities are particularly concerned to hear for certain what their grant entitlements will be for 1981-82, and it would be helpful for them to know exactly where they stand before they enter their important rate-fixing cycle in January. For this reason I would be most grateful foryou assurance that a firm slot can be reserved in the Parliamentary timetable for the necessary debate on the floor of the House in the week beginning 14 December.

PRESENTATION IN THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY OF THE
UK CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMUNITY BUDGET

This letter and its enclosures amplify the figures and
explanations in my letter of 2 July about the UK
contribution to the Community Budget.

The material falls into two parts, and is summarised in
the two tables attached.

Table I is concerned with FESG figures. It starts with
the last published figures in Cmnd 7641 for our net
contribution. It then revises these figures to take
account of all developments since publication, other than
the refunds under the 30 May Agreement. Finally it
applies those refunds. The main feature of this table
is the effect of the time lag on our refunds, even though
it assumes that we secure an advance payment of £135
million (300 meua at 1979 outturn prices) before the end
of 1980. (We shall not know what advance we will get
in 1980 until after the German elections.)

Table II reconciles the familiar Commission figures for
our net contribution after the 30 May agreement with the
FESG figures at the foot of Table I. It shows how the
figures in the 30 May Agreement, which described the intended
outcome in respect of the years 1980 and 1981, need to be
adjusted in order to show the expected cash flow in 1980
and 1981.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND THE BAE FLOTATION

As you know, Sir Keith Joseph saw the Chancellor this morning to discuss whether the Defence programme could be made exempt from the current public expenditure reductions, and be maintained at the Cmnd 7841 planned levels, in order at least partially to resolve current uncertainties about future orders for British Aerospace which will otherwise preclude the privatisation of BAe next month. I understand that Sir Keith Joseph may intend to mention the matter to the Prime Minister tomorrow.

The Chancellor explained to Sir Keith Joseph this morning that the level of cuts in total public expenditure which, in his view and that of the Chief Secretary, are now required necessitates a substantial contribution from Defence. While regretting the delay to the privatisation of BAe, he saw no way in which an exemption for could be contrived. At his request, I have subsequently sent to Sir Keith Joseph's office a copy of the attached note by officials which sets out some of the considerations underlying his view that the Defence figures are both essential and defensible within the Alliance.

It may be helpful to set out for your information some figures relevant to the arrangement which Sir Keith Joseph had in mind.

Dear Chairman of the Industry:

THE RATE SUPPORT GRANT ORDERS

My Private Secretary wrote to yours on 21 August about the timetable for decisions leading up to this autumn's RSG settlements.

As you know, my preference has been for a settlement on 21 November, in view of the advantages this will bring in giving the earliest possible notification to authorities of their grant entitlements for 1981-82, with the influence this can have on their rating decisions, and in view of the better prospect of a debate on the RSG Orders before Christmas. Working back from this date would mean a final Cabinet decision on the RSG package on 23 October, following the second meeting of MISC 21 on 13 October.

However, it is now quite clear from the first meeting of MISC 21 on 25 September that we will not be able to prepare a paper in time for the meeting due on 13 October. We have more, not fewer, grant distribution options to exemplify and consider with colleagues. Bearing in mind that we shall be at Brighton for much of the previous week I fear I have no option but to call off the MISC 21 meeting arranged for 13 October and ask instead for a meeting in the week commencing 20 October. This of course makes it impracticable to consider the settlement package as a whole in Cabinet until 30 October. As you know, this means in practice that we must plan for a week's slippage in the RSG settlement date until 28 November to allow adequate time for essential computation and for checking all the calculations. I am, however, still hopeful that we could have the RSG debate in the week before the House rises for the Christmas recess; indeed I believe we must aim to do so if we are to maximise our influence over local authority budgeting and also to help reduce the embarrassment of having to delay the settlement.

THE PRIME MINISTER

14 July, 1980.

Dear Mr. Greet,

Thank you for your letter of 4 July, informing me of the resolution on public expenditure cuts passed by the Methodist Conference in Sheffield.

Of course, like all my colleagues, I share our concern at the need to make savings in public expenditure, especially at a time of world economic recession.  I can assure you that we regret the need for temporary sacrifices in living standards and keep a very close eye on the effects of reductions in spending.  Indeed, we have made substantial reallocations of spending priorities in order to concentrate more resources on those in greatest need, rather than spreading them thinly over a wider area.

But I must ask you to consider which is likely, in the long run, to have the more disastrous effects on the lives of those in need - a continuing very high rate of inflation, with permanently high levels of unemployment, or a policy designed to reduce inflation to acceptable levels and restore the ability of British industry to create wealth and new jobs.

I have no doubt that persistent inflation is the worst enemy of the poor, the old and the disadvantaged.  If we can conquer that - as we can, through our present policies and by no other means - the temporary sacrifices will have been worthwhile.",1980-07-14,The Prime Minister,Mr. Greet,Response to letter about public expenditure cuts,Letter,PREM 19-167/0001/-160.jpg,"Prime Minister's Office, No. 10 Downing Street","The letter is addressed to the Prime Minister and responds to a resolution passed by the Methodist Conference on public expenditure cuts, which falls within the remit of the Prime Minister's Office to establish and deliver the government's overall policy priorities.",1980-08-11

Cash Limits in 1979/80

The Prime Minister has read the Chief Secretary's minute of 3 July and the draft White Paper on cash limit outturns for 1979-80 which he enclosed with it.  The Prime Minister is content with the draft, but she has asked me to say that she is very disturbed by the number of cases of overspend which it reports.

CASH LIMITS IN 1979-80

We are due to publish around the end of this month the usual Paper showing the provisional out-turn of expenditure against cash limits in 1979-80. A draft is attached, following the strictly factual format of the corresponding White Paper which we published last year. I send it to you and Cabinet colleagues for formal approval for publication. If anyone wishes to comment, I should be glad to hear by 10 July.

2. The vast majority of cash limits were once again correctly observed in 1979-80. In aggregate there was as usual some under-spending. Central Government cash limits were underspent in total by about £325m, equivalent to under 1%. Underspending in previous years was rather larger: 1.5% in 1978-79, 2.6% in 1977-78 and 2.6% in 1976-77.

3. But there was a disturbing increase in the number of cases of overspend. The number of breaches of cash limits was two in 1976-77, two in 1977-78, four in 1978-79. Last year there were no less than twelve. The amounts were in most cases not significant, but the increase in number is worrying and does not accord well with the importance which, as a Government, we attach to controlling expenditure.

4. This matter was mentioned at Cabinet today. I take the further opportunity of this minute to remind colleagues in charge of spending departments of our collective commitment to cash limits as an effective control on expenditure. Subject in one or two cases to specific agreements to review, we must adhere strictly to the cash limits which have been set, on which the Budget was based. This will undoubtedly cause difficulties in many areas this year, but the strategic need is imperative.",1980-07-01,Prime Minister,Cabinet Colleagues,Cash Limits in 1979-80,Letter,PREM 19-167/0001/-207.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses the management of cash limits and government spending, which is the responsibility of the HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry.",1980-07-29

Dear Realio,

TIMING OF RSG SETTLEMENT

The Chancellor wrote to my Secretary of State on 8 August proposing that final Cabinet decisions on the 1981/82 rate support grant settlement be deferred until 30 October.

In the absence of both the Secretary of State and Mr King on holiday I enclose 'without prejudice' a note by DUE officials commenting on this proposal. You will see that they think a decision to defer would be premature, and could put unnecessarily at risk the completion of the RSG timetable before Christmas.
They suggest that if it should prove necessary to defer decisions by a week this decision can be taken in the light of events in October.

We shall, of course, put the Chancellor's letter before the Secretary of State when he returns, and I will let you know his reactions as soon as possible.

CASH LIMITS 1979-80

The Prime Minister has now had an opportunity to consider the Lord Advocate's minute of 11 July, and the Chief Secretary's recent minute commenting on it.

The Prime Minister has noted the circumstances which gave rise to the overspend of £160,000 on the Lord Advocate's cash limit for 1979-80, and that he has agreed to provide a token reduction of £25,000 in this year's cash limit by way of offset. She agrees with the Chief Secretary that it is essential to avoid undermining the principle of compensating for excess expenditure against cash limits, and that he should pursue the possibility of finding the remaining £135,000 with the Secretary of State for Scotland.

The Rt Hon John Biffen MP

Dear John,

As you will have heard from your officials, problems are arising on the public expenditure front in Northern Ireland.
This is mainly because additional funds are required to support much needed industrial investment, as cases resulting from the
inward investment drive over the past couple of years move
along the pipeline. This is essentially demand-determined
expenditure which cannot be tightly controlled.

I have been over the ground in detail with my Ministerial
colleagues and my officials in the light of developments
since we settled the public expenditure levels for 1980-81
in Cmnd 7847. I have sought to exploit to the absolute
maximum the scope for meeting requirements, by reallocating
£50.5m from within my existing resources. However, even after
doing this and paring to the bone all claims on my resources
I am still left with a gap of the order of £50m which I see
no prospect of closing from the means at my disposal.

The rigorous action of excision and reallocation in which I
have engaged carries with it very serious difficulties for
us here in NI. It will involve us in virtually eliminating
new capital starts for the remainder of the financial year,
eroding standards in the classroom, departing from the commitment to maintain planned expenditure in the health service,
substantially reducing our support for the agricultural industry,
and could cost us something of the order of 5,000 jobs in the
face of what is the worst unemployment problem of any region
in the United Kingdom.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE: END-YEAR FLEXIBILITY

You kindly sent me a copy of your minute to the Prime Minister on this subject, circulated for information.

I am grateful to you for pointing up my strong support for the proposed scheme and am glad to see that it has your support also. I firmly believe that the present 'annuality rule' leads to inefficiencies in public expenditure as it induces Departments to rush to spend at the end of the financial year and penalises those who, in trying to avoid an overspend (especially in the difficult to control capital programmes) end up with an underspend. The proposed scheme will sensibly overcome these problems. I do hope, therefore, that your colleagues will feel able to agree to its introduction this year.

TIMING OF RSG SETTLEMENT

I have been giving careful consideration to the complex of decisions we shall have to take in the autumn on public spending and our economic strategy generally. One important piece of the jigsaw will be the decision on 1981-82 RSG - a final view on volume and a decision on the inflation factors to apply there and for all the other cash limits. But there are many other elements to be fitted in starting with monetary and other decisions within the framework of the medium-term financial strategy, flowing through to decisions on the kind of public borrowing figures that may be tolerable for 1981-82 and the implications of this for spending programmes generally.

To come straight to the point, I think it would be a mistake for us to make final decisions on RSG - or indeed any significant component of public spending - before the end of October. We really must leave ourselves adequate time, after our return from the Party Conference, to get 1980 PESC decisions right given that they will be absolutely crucial to the success of our strategy over this Parliament. Certainly the earliest Cabinet meeting to which John Biffen and I could put properly-considered proposals to Cabinet will be 30 October.

I understand that you have been thinking in terms of an announcement of the RSG settlement on 21 November, which given the difficulties of the exemplification exercise this year would imply a Cabinet decision on RSG in the third week of October. I therefore write now to say that I think it would be very much in the general interest to postpone a Cabinet decision on RSG to 30 October. I realise that this may well mean slipping the settlement date correspondingly to 28 November, with some risk that the consequent /compression",1980-08-08,"The Rt. Hon.

I have made certain that the Prime Minister's wish that you should be consulted on the more difficult cases is kept in mind. All this could be upon you felt, some early papers could appear for review in the next year or so for possible release in 1986, and we will maintain a particular watch for these.

I am also informing my people concerned with considering applications for privileged access that papers are not to be made available for research before they are opened at the PRO.

Dear Robert,

1. I have been thinking about the correspondence between you and Frank Cooper and others, about the release of Suez records, and a point has occurred to me to which you may like to consider further.

2. It concerns the passage in your letter of 30 June to Frank, where you note that, over the release of the Suez papers, there may be more cases than usual when Departments might find it necessary to take the views of their Ministers. In point of fact, Ministers - in this Department at least - seem rarely, if ever, to have been consulted about the release of documents to the public domain. One reason for this is no doubt the convention by which Ministers do not have access to the papers of a previous Administration of a different political complexion. If this convention were to be strictly applied over the release of the Suez records, then reference to Ministers could mean either that the convention were flouted or that we would be pursuing different courses of action depending upon which Party was in power at the time.

3. Much will depend upon the nature of the documents concerned, but I can see that it might prove necessary to take the view of Ministers in certain cases. I should have thought however that, in such cases of doubt, it would be best if in the first instance you were alerted by the Department affected so that you could then decide whether to seek the views of Ministers and if so how. It would seem preferable to act in this way rather than for officials in the various Departments to seek the views of Departmental Ministers in a piecemeal fashion before you had been consulted.

Review of Suez Records

I was grateful for your letter of 23rd July and Frank Cooper's letter of 8th August.

As you say it is unusual to bring Ministers into the review of public records. But under section 5(1) of the Public Records Act 1958 the Lord Chancellor's prescription that a record should be closed for a period longer than the normal 30 years is made ""with the approval, or at the request, of the Minister or other person, who appears to him to be primarily concerned"". Although officials may normally act for Ministers in submitting recommendations to the Lord Chancellor about extended closure, this statutory provision confers a duty upon Ministers to give approvals or a right upon them to make requests; and that must surely mean that the possibility of their being consulted cannot be excluded.

In my letter of 30th June I was not intending to suggest that the arrangements for reviewing the Suez records should be different from those customarily employed. It was in my mind, however, that the Suez records might present some unusually difficult aspects which could call for consultation of Ministers. I agree with you and Frank that, if instances arise where Departments think it necessary to consult Ministers, I should be consulted first, so that we can then consider whether to seek the views of Ministers and how. As Frank says, this would help to ensure consistency of treatment.

In this connection I am not too troubled by the convention by which Ministers do not have access to the papers of a previous Administration of a different political complexion, although, if the question of consulting Ministers about Suez papers arose during the term of office of a Labour Government, compliance with that convention could well require the Prime Minister of the day to consult the Leader of the Opposition before a Departmental Minister was consulted.",1980-08-13,"Sir Robert Armstrong, Secretary of the Cabinet","Sir Michael Palliser, GCMG",Review of Suez Records,Letter,PREM 19/0001/-25.jpg,Cabinet Office,"The Cabinet Office provides support to the Prime Minister and ensures the effective running of government.

papers can and cannot be released to the Public Record Office at that date.

sure that release is not delayed when the time comes in 1986.

3. The Ministry of Defence papers on Suez have, since 1963, been kept
under a special embargo within the Ministry which has prevented them from
being available for study or reference.   This embargo was imposed by the
then Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Macmillan, following an attempt by the
then Chief of the Defence Staff, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, to have them
made available for a study of the Suez campaign by the Joint Services Staff
College.   This embargo will need to be lifted, if the review of the papers
with a view to release to the PRO is to be started; and, as the embargo was
imposed by a Prime Minister it can be lifted only by his successor.

4. When the embargo was imposed, the events of Suez were only 7 years
away, and many of those directly concerned were still active in public life.
It is now over 20 years since the Suez affair: almost all of those directly
concerned at senior level are out of public life, and many are no longer living.
It seems to me to be not unreasonable to lift the Macmillan embargo to the
extent required to enable the Ministry of Defence to review the papers and to
decide which can be released in 1986 and which must be held for a longer
period.   I think, however, the papers should not be made available for other
purposes of study or reference before 1986.

5. I should be grateful for the Prime Minister's authority to lift the
embargo to that extent.

MOD Study Group: Access to Suez Records

Following the report last year by the House of Commons
Select Committee on Defence on relations between the Ministry of
Defence and the Press during the Falklands conflict, the
Ministry of Defence has established a study group under the
chairmanship of General Sir Hugh Beach, formerly Master General
of the Ordnance, to consider whether any new measures, including
the introduction of a system of censorship, are necessary in
order to protect military information immediately before or
during a conflict. The members of the study group (list attached)
have signed an Official Secrets Act declaration and are cleared
for access up to secret.

2. The study group have asked for information on the approach
to censorship and military control of information in ""small wars""
since the Second World War, and the Ministry of Defence is
preparing a paper for the group on the practice both in the
Second World War and since. Probably the best example and,
apart from Korea, the only post-war example of censorship being
imposed on the British media during a limited conflict was the
Suez operation, and it would therefore clearly be useful for the
Suez experience to be included in this paper.

3. The official papers relating to the Suez operation are not
due for release under the 30 year rule until 1986. Ministry of
Defence papers on the operation have, since 1963, been subject
to a special embargo imposed by the then Prime Minister,
Mr Harold MacMillan, which prevents them from being made available
for study or for reference. The embargo was lifted by the
Prime Minister in June 1980 to the extent necessary to enable
the archive to be reviewed in preparation for deciding what
should be released to the Public Record Office and what should
be retained when the 30 year point is reached.

Dear Robert,

REVIEW OF SUEZ RECORDS

1. Thank you for your letter of 13 August.

2. Our exchange of correspondence has underlined some of the difficulties which may arise when reviewing the Suez records in readiness for their opening at the Public Record Office. I do not think however we can take the consideration of this problem further forward at present. When our records staff start work on these particular papers they should be well aware that extra care must be observed with their review.
During the course of, or at the latest on the completion of, sensitivity reviews on Suez records I see advantage in a meeting being called of Departmental Record Officers, to consider any problems which had arisen when dealing with these papers. Permanent Secretaries could then be informed about any documents requiring special consideration, possibly at Ministerial level.

3. Another aspect of the review which Departmental Record Officers might also be invited to consider is the preparation of a press release when the bulk of Suez records are opened to the public in January 1987. This release could be more detailed than the usual one which the Public Record Office draft for interested journalists at the beginning of each year. It would link together the Suez papers of the various Departments concerned.

1981-82 CASH LIMITS

My statement today covers certain general aspects of the 1981-82 cash limits relating to pay in the public services.  To avoid any misunderstanding I am writing now to inform you and the Treasury and Civil Service Committee of two further specific points; and I am releasing this letter to the press.

First, the prospective increase in the paybill between financial years.  In particular cash limits on Total, the actual percentage increase between 1980-81 and 1981-82 in the provision for pay will differ from the announced provision for the increase in earnings from due settlement dates.  The number employed may change.  In some cases the settlement date is not 1 April, so that each financial year will include a period at the rate before and a period at the rate after the due settlement date.  In addition, the increase in the provision for pay between 1980-81 and 1981-82 will be affected in some cases by settlements having been staged in 1980-81, with increases paid later than the usual settlement dates, but such staging not being repeated in 1981-82.  This last will contribute some 1 per cent to the increase in the total public service paybill between the two years.

Second, staging:  The staging of awards has in the past resulted in a higher rate of pay being carried forward into subsequent years than otherwise would have been consistent with the cash limit.  This erodes the effectiveness of the cash limit system and confuses comparisons of the growth of earnings.",1980-11-01,"Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street, SWIP 3AG","The Rt. Hon.

From the Private Secretary

Dear Milam,

The Prime Minister was grateful for your Secretary Survey 1980, the first results of which are to be published on 29 October.

The Prime Minister agrees that the earnings figures as produced by the statisticians, which include last year's Civil Service settlement even though it was not implemented until 7 May, must be accepted. But she has questioned the tone of the minute. In her view, there is no point in trying to talk down the figures because, whatever is said by way of interpretation, it will be believed. Rather than going on the defensive, she believes it would far better for Ministers to use the figures to demonstrate that no Government has given the public sector a treatment as favourable as this one, and that this cannot be allowed to continue unless and until the private sector recovers.

I am sending copies of this letter to John Wiggins (HM Treasury), Sir Robert Armstrong (Lord President's Office), Richard Prescott (Paymaster General's Office), Richard Riley (Department of Industry) and to the Private Secretaries to all other members of E Committee (to whom I have asked you to send copies of Mr. Prior's minute) and also to David Wright (Cabinet Office).

New Earnings Survey

Thank you for letting me see Mr. Prior's minute of 23 October, and the enclosure, about the forthcoming publication of the New Earnings Survey. We have known for some time that this particular loose was about to crawl out of the wood work; because of the potential adverse effect on private sector pay settlements, the problem was drawn to the attention of the Dixon Group at its last meeting, and the Department of Employment were asked to take whatever steps were necessary to straighten out the statistical nonsense. They failed to do so - apparently it would have involved a completely new set of sample interviews - but Mr. Prior did warn the Chancellor and the Pay-master General earlier this week that the problem was coming up, and arrangements were made to ensure that the figures in the new earnings survey would be published on the same day as an article explaining them in the Gazette, so that at least the media would only have one go at the issue.

I was shown Mr. Prior's minute and enclosure in draft, but the proposed briefing note still does not adequately reflect the point I made then, which is that neither the background nor the notes for use address themselves sufficiently clearly to the particular problem of central government pay rises. Accordingly I suggest the following amendments:

(i) A new paragraph to follow the existing paragraph 1, as follows:
This briefing is defensive. We do not want to draw more attention to the NES than it will otherwise attract, partly because the figures show high public sector increases (and may therefore discourage pay moderation in the private sector) and more partly because, for statistical reasons, a proportion of the 1979 settlement has been aggregated with the whole of the 1980 settlement, so as to produce very high figures for central government.",1980-11-01,MR.

FORTHCOMING ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS

1. I had a session with Professor Burns this morning, at his request, to run over the ground generally and to have a first look at the forthcoming economic announcements. Mrs. Gilmore was present. We agreed that you and I should have a separate meeting with him on either Friday, 21 November, or Monday morning, 24 November, to ensure we are fully au fait with the details.

If you agree, I think we should try and make it Friday: Monday is getting a bit late.

2. As you know, the broad shape of the announcement is now taking shape. Because the unemployment figures are to be announced on the 25th, and will again be bad, the Opposition are likely to choose that day for the economic day of the Debate on the Address.

So the likely day for the announcement is Tuesday, 25 November.

The announcement will cover:

(i) Public expenditure decisions
(ii) Fiscal changes: PPT and employees NIS
(iii) Monetary issues: MBC and rollover
(iv) EPLS.

The Industry Act forecast may well be published on the same day.

3. There are three presentational difficulties in this timing:

(i) I understand that the Prime Minister may well be saying something about the economic strategy on the opening day of the debate, 20 November: what will she be able to say?

(ii) We shall not by 25 November have a very good idea of the November banking figures.

(iii) Speculation about MLR. You will want to see Mr. Lankester's record of the Prime Minister's meeting on 13 November, attached (Mr. Lankester has asked me to stress that this is for your and my eyes only).

'My statement today covers certain general aspects of the 1981-82 cash limits relating to pay in the public services. To avoid any misunderstanding I am writing now to inform you and the Treasury and Civil Service Committee of two further specific points; and I am releasing this letter to the press.

The Government therefore thinks it desirable for the future to avoid the delay or staging of awards, and will avoid it where it is itself the employer. If, this general policy notwithstanding, a public services employer were to delay or stage an award, the Government, when setting the relevant cash limits for the subsequent year, would not allow for the element of the award which had only been made compatible with the cash limit by such delay or staging.'",1980-11-24,"The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Sir Geoffrey Howe, QC MP","the Rt Hon Edward Du Cann, MP, Chairman of the Treasury and Civil Service Committee",1981-82 Cash Limits,Letter,PREM 19-174/0001/-65.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses cash limits and pay in the public services, which falls under the remit of the HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry responsible for setting economic policy and managing public spending.",1980-12-22

POLICY OPTIONS

I reported to you at the time the substance of my talk with the Prime Minister on 20 October when you were in Luxembourg and when she had just received from the ICI Chairman the news of the Company's third quarter loss. The Prime Minister expressed a very strong wish that I should explore ways of mitigating the adverse conditions in which British industry is operating, so that good and viable companies like ICI should not be driven to the wall. You yourself endorsed this wish and authorised me to submit some options to you.

2. I have done this in consultation with the Second Permanent Secretaries and a handful of people who have been drawn into the discussion on a strict ""need to know"" basis. I told the Governor in general terms what I was doing, but did not reveal in any detail what the scope of the study was.

3. It is important to establish at the outset the nature of the problem which we wish to resolve. The strong financial pressure to which business generally is subjected is one manifestation of the policy which is intended to slow down the rate of inflation. I have never myself believed that the statement of the commitment to a deceleration in monetary growth would, through expectations, lead rapidly and as it were on its own account to a fall in wage settlements. In time expectations could well play an important part but until they do, the pressures on wage bargainers and price fixers has to be through powerful financial and economic forces - in short an inability of the customer (employer) to afford the goods or services in question at the price that would otherwise be offered.

4. It seems to me that the success we have been, and can look forward to, having on the inflation front stems directly from this. To appeal therefore for a relief from these financial pressures is implicitly to appeal against the policy being pursued, or at any rate to appeal to amend it.",N/A,Chancellor of the Exchequer,"Mr Burns, Sir Kenneth Couzens, Sir Anthony Rawlinson, Mr Ryrie",Policy Options,Letter,PREM 19-174/0001/-232.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses policy options to mitigate adverse conditions for British industry, particularly in relation to the financial pressures caused by the government's policy to slow down the rate of inflation.

EFFECTS OF INCREASED NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS ON PAY BARGAINING

The increased National Insurance Contributions payable by employees from next April, which you recently announced, and which are provided for in the National Insurance (Contributions) Bill, will have a significant effect on employees' take home pay and on the Tax and Prices Index; and we need to bear in mind the potential effects on future pay negotiations.

I attach some examples which have been sent to me by a company which has recently concluded a wage negotiation in the 17% range. As you will see the combined effect of tax and the new NI contributions will be to claw back about half of the negotiated increases. The changes bear most heavily on the craftsmen. In the case of example B the employee concerned will, as from April, take home only £7.62 of his prior increase of £16 a week. In other words over 52% of his pay increase is lost to him.

The company is worried that once the size of the claw back is fully understood by trade union officials and by individual employees, there will be pressure for the settlements to be re-opened. They also fear that it will be harder to single figure settlements in future. We may find these attitudes reflected more widely. You will no doubt remember that after the miners' ballot was known, that the result would be significantly affected by the announcement about increased NI contributions.

I am not, of course, suggesting that we should reconsider decisions on increasing NI contributions on the NIL unless we find ourselves obliged to do so by our own back benchers. But I am sure you will agree that we need to be very much aware of the potential effects on pay bargaining, and to take it fully into account when considering any changes in personal taxation for the next Budget.",1980-12-15,Carton House Tothill Street London SW1H 9NA,Rt Hon Sir Geoffrey Howe QC MP,Effects of increased National Insurance Contributions on pay bargaining,Letter,PREM 19-174/0001/-76.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses the potential impact of increased National Insurance Contributions on employees' take-home pay and future pay negotiations, which is within the remit of the HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry responsible for taxation policy.",1981-01-12

Policy Options

1. I have read Sir Douglas Wass's paper on Policy Options dated 5th November and have the following comments:

(i) I remain convinced that the way in which industry needs to be helped is by reducing the exchange rate rather than by more general easing at this juncture.

(ii) I would agree with the view that attention should be concentrated on options (i) and (ii).

(iii) Expert opinion seems to have little confidence in the effectiveness of option (i) and this suggests that option (ii) may be the one that should be tried. Personally, I still feel intuitively that there may be more in option (i) than at present appears. However, I cannot substantiate this belief with hard fact and argument. My feeling is undoubtedly influenced by experience of other commodity markets - see, for example, the point below on timing.

(iv) It appears that neither of these options is regarded as likely to have a major effect. In these circumstances the manner in which either is tried and, in particular, the timing is likely to be crucial. For example, a modest cut in interest rates may be more effective if it coincides with some weakening of the exchange rate for other (fortuitous) reasons. As in all market operations confidence must be a key factor. On the influences that affect this I would be more guided by the pragmatic judgement of experienced successful operators than by intellectual analysis which probably has to be over-simplified.

The questions we have to ask in reviewing Government strategy seem to me to be these:

(1) Are you satisfied that the Government's central strategy is going well enough?

(2) If not - is this due to lack of clear objectives, or lack of an adequate strategy, or failure to implement the strategy?

(3) If strategy or implementation are at fault - do you believe that colleagues and officials can put it right?

(4) If so - will they do it by trying harder? Or by starting all over again? Or by working in a different way? Or some combination of these?

(5) If putting it right requires working in a different way - where will this new way come from?

The paper is written from the businessman's viewpoint: that is, it assumes that when things do not go according to plan, you must look at the organisation and the way of thinking and working, rather than at the people concerned. Business experience suggests that even the ablest people are quite useless if the approach and organisation is wrong. The quality of people alone is not enough. Experience at making new things happen counts too. This is an entrepreneurial skill.

In the Policy Unit, we are amateurs in the political field, in the Parliamentary and legislative process. We would fall flat on our faces if we suddenly tried to operate in that area.

INDUSTRY ACT FORECAST

The Prime Minister will be aware that the Industry Act (1975) requires the Government to publish economic forecasts twice a year. The Chancellor will therefore be putting out on 24 November with the other supporting documents a press notice on the forecast, the format of which is very much the same as a year ago.

As you know, the Chancellor has no enthusiasm for publishing forecasts, particularly if they bring little cheer. The Treasury Committee has been pressing him to publish more than at Budget time and we shall be going a little way to meet them - on manufacturing and North Sea output, and on world trade. These parts of the forecast have, in one form or another, been published before.

I attach the main table from the press notice: this is the part of the forecast that usually receives the most attention in the press.

So far as prices are concerned, the forecast envisages a further substantial reduction in the inflation rate from 15! per cent in the fourth quarter of this year to 11 per cent in the corresponding quarter next year. The Chancellor has considered whether, in view of recent good progress on the inflation front, a lower forecast could be justified. The text will make clear that single figure inflation by the end of next year is no means ruled out; but in view of the fact that we are unlikely to have this year's favourable (so far as inflation is concerned) but not from the standpoint of industrial profitability) factors - an appreciating exchange rate and declining profit margins - repeating themselves, the Chancellor thinks it would be better to stick with the figure which has already been agreed for the non-pay elements in next year's cash limits. He notes that a new forecast, which could present a more favourable inflation picture if intervening developments warrant this, will have to be published with the 1981 Budget, and that the size of the uprating will depend on that forecast.",1980-11-19,Treasury Chambers,"T.F.

Dear Mr.,

As you know, the Prime Minister held a meeting yesterday afternoon with the Chancellor and Sir Douglas Wass to discuss Sir Douglas' paper on policy options for taking the pressure off the corporate sector (your letter of 7 November refers).
Sir Robert Armstrong was also present.

The Chancellor said that he had decided that the immediate aim must be to go for option II - i.e. an early, modest reduction in interest rates. He had in mind a reduction in MLR of 2 per cent. To enable this to take place, he would need to be able to demonstrate that the Government was not abandoning the monetary strategy, and he would therefore need to announce in his speech in the Debate on the Addresses a credible package of measures. His intention was to announce a further extension of Granny bonds and a probably a restricted indexed gilt, the outcome of the current public expenditure review, the external financing limits for the nationalised industries in 1981/82, an increase in PRT and the increase in employee contributions in about £1 billion in 1981/82, and an increase in employee national insurance contribution. He would also have to announce the roll forward of the monetary target and the Government's conclusions on the monetary and fiscal stance against the background of the Industry Act forecast which would be published at the same time. Final decisions still had to be taken on most of these matters; he hoped that - even though the conclusions on public expenditure was likely to be disappointing - the various measures taken together would produce a setting in which the 2 per cent MLR reduction could be recognised that it would involve a considerable element of risk: questions would be raised as to whether the Government was doing enough to get the fiscal balance right, and these doubts would have to be even more restrictive; alternatively, it might conceivably be necessary to put MLR up again.

As regards the other options, the Chancellor said that he had concluded that option I - i.e. inflationary controls - should not be adopted alongside a reduction in MLR. The two together would give the impression that the Government was moving to an exchange rate objective. But if it turned out that the MLR reduction was not possible, it would probably be necessary to announce a package of inflow controls to show that the Government was 'doing something', even though the Chancellor did not think that they would have any significant effect. He had rejected the other options in Sir Douglas' paper.",1980-11-13,Private Secretary,Mr.,Copy to Master get Domestic Monetary Policy,Letter,PREM 19-174/0001/-217.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses policy options related to interest rates, monetary strategy, and fiscal measures, which fall under the remit of the HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry.",1980-12-11

POLICY OPTIONS

There is one point which I forgot to mention in the note of yesterday's meeting which I sent to you earlier today.

The Prime Minister said that she hoped that it would be possible to have some idea of the November banking figures by 20 November, when she would be making her speech in the Debate on the Address. It would be highly desirable to have this, for the possibility of being able to reduce MLR the following week would affect the tone of her speech.

Sir Douglas Wass explained the difficulties of speeding up the collection of the figures, but said he would see what could be done, at least to get a flavour of it.

CHANCELLOR

I agree with the general drift of your discussion at No 11 on 11 November, and support the idea of an early reduction in MLR. However the reasons which how lead me to do so are perhaps worth recording, even though I have not had the opportunity to put them down very succinctly.

2. Douglas Wass's cover note suggests (para 3 of his Guy Fawkes' day minute) we need to begin by establishing the problems to be resolved. I would suggest that there are two. Present conditions threaten to make dangerous nonsense of the Government's commitment to controlling the money supply, and in the near future at that; and looking further ahead they pose an equally serious threat to the MTFS. There are, of course, plenty of other difficulties in the economy which are crying out for resolution. But they are of secondary interest at the moment.

3. Douglas asks (para 5) whether present policy is too severe, given the objectives and the costs entailed. My answer is unequivocally, ""yes"". I suspect that, had we been armed with a plausible and up-to-date medium-term assessment, his might have been too. He suggests (para 6) that business conditions, as they have evolved this year, are not significantly more serious than we expected them to be at the time the MTPS was set. That may be so in terms of trade and consumer's expenditure, but surely not in other respects. For example,

- the real exchange rate is way above the projected level;
- the company sector deficit is worse than anticipated;
- the growth of Bank lending to the corporate sector has accelerated;

Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy: 2 October

I have consulted the Prime Minister on the question of whether Mr. Prior's employment proposals should be considered on 2 October with a view to announcing decisions at the Party Conference, or later in the month alongside the proposals on public expenditure.

The Prime Minister takes the view that Mr. Prior's proposals must be considered alongside the other proposals on industrial support. And in any event, she thinks it would be better to make any announcement in the Debate on the Address, rather than at the Party Conference.

You wrote to Cabinet colleagues on 12 August seeking comments on proposals for further work by the Group.

I am generally happy with the 5 key areas for future work listed in Annex A of the note enclosed with your letter. Under the first heading, fiscal incentives, I have a particular interest in profit sharing and share ownership schemes.

I am very much involved in the second area, labour mobility, and look forward to seeing the CPRS report on options.

Under the heading of reducing burdens placed on industry by Government, the two references to health and safety were both embraced with the report of the CPRS which was taken by B(EA) on 31 July. Further work on the CPRS recommendations is being undertaken by the inter-departmental working party of officials under Patrick Mayhew's chairmanship, and it seems to me that these items might therefore be transferred to Annex D as being adequately in hand.

Under the heading of measures to help small firms I look forward to seeing the progress report from the Treasury working group.

I am very much concerned with the last heading, industry/training/ education. I am about to circulate to E Committee the report by officials on options on industrial training, together with my own comments.

Dear Richard,

NEW EARNINGS SURVEY

The Chancellor has seen your Secretary of State's letter
of 16 October about the first results of this year's New
Earnings Survey.

He agrees that it is most unfortunate that the sensitive
political issue of the presentation of public service pay,
and in particular the pay of the non-industrial civil
service was not considered at Ministerial level. He assumes
that your Department have made arrangements to ensure that
this is not repeated.

He is nevertheless in agreement with Mr. Prior's judgement
that it is better to get the high Civil Service Settlement
out of the way this year than to have it included in next
year's Survey figures, and notes from her Private
Secretary's letter of 27 October that the Prime Minister is
content for publication to go ahead without delay.

As to presentation, the Chancellor shares the Prime Minister's
view that the Government should adopt a fairly robust attitude
towards these figures. No doubt the significance of the
catching up element, and the fact that public service
employees have done relatively less well over a longer
timescale can serve as useful defensive points; but we
should equally make clear - as the Chancellor has done in
recent speeches - that the public services have enjoyed
substantial improvements in pay under the present Government,
not to mention their other relative advantages in terms of
job security and pension provision.

I am copying this letter to the Private Secretaries to the
members of E Committee, and also to Jim Buckley (Lord
President's Office), Richard Prescott (Paymaster-General's

You asked for my comments on Jim Prior's note to the Prime Minister about ""Earnings 1979-80"".

We have just one brief and general comment.  Jim seems to be mostly concerned (and by implication, Geoffrey Howe and Christopher Soames likewise) to ""talk down"" the New Earnings Survey because it contains such large figures.

This seems to be quite the wrong way round.  If our objectives are to create a climate which is (a) conducive to low public sector settlements, and (b) which helps us to explain cause and effect to the public (these huge increases, including the private sector, have to be paid for in unemployment, high MLR, expenditure cuts, higher taxes), the high figures in the Survey strengthen our case.

In any case, they are so horrendous, however we talk them down, compared with the realities of our situation, that we risk looking ridiculous if we appear to be investing great effort in making absurdly high figures look slightly less absurd.  Better to say that we've all behaved like greedy idiots and are now paying the price, and it would be stupid and (in the public sector) wicked to sustain such behaviour for another year.

Dear Mr.,

In my minute to the Prime Minister of 25 June, I undertook to let you have some ideas for outside speakers who might help in putting our ideas across during the summer. I attach a short list, which could be extended substantially if we eventually concluded that it was right to try to encourage a programme of suitable speeches from outside the Government and from outside the ranks of our supporters in Parliament.

But as you will have recognised from my minute to the Prime Minister, I believe that there are dangers in your proposals which we ought to consider very carefully. I detect a similar uneasiness in John Nott's minute of 22 June. Although there are many in industry, in the City and in public life generally who are likely to be sympathetic to our broad policy aims, I do not think that we should assume that they would therefore necessarily wish to appear publicly to identify themselves with us. I know, of course, that you have in mind non-political reinforcement of the themes which we are seeking to put across - the need for higher productivity, readiness to accept change, the irrelevance of class divisions - but it is difficult to test these issues without reference to policy instruments, and to invite help from anybody who is not an active supporter must run the risk of misunderstanding. More than this, if our efforts to enlist outside speakers were made public, I believe that the media (not to mention our opponents) could make damaging misrepresentations of our intentions. And frankly, I find it difficult to believe that most of those who would be prepared to speak if nudged to do so could be expected to carry the public at large. I hope, therefore, that we shall have an opportunity to reflect fully on the implications of what is proposed.

I saw Sir John Methven last Monday.  He was extremely positive on the
Budget and our well-judged attitude to the unions.  He believes there are
signs of a new and more positive mood in management because a Government
has at last done something positive to help them.

He was emphatic that the union leaders were on the defensive, well aware
that they had lost a great deal of their authority and moral credibility.
They were anxious to be seen as responsible people co-operating with
Government.

Methven wondered whether an ""Economic Summit"" in which Government, TUC
and CBI tried to establish a shared understanding of the UK economic
problem, would be useful.  He realised the overtones of corporatism etc,
which he does not favour.  But he felt that the monthly NEDC meetings
were simply rituals in which nothing serious got discussed.  I have since
tried the Summit idea on Keith Joseph and Jim Prior, with guarded
enthusiasm from the former but very little from the latter.  I suspect
that the trade union leaders are almost irrelevant, now, to the things
we have to do.  All we should be concerned with, therefore, is to keep
them on the moral and economic defensive so that they can do little harm.

The Prime Minister has received the enclosed letter from
Mr. Len Murray together with a copy of the General Council's state-
ment on the Government's economic policy and a motion for submission
to the 1979 Trades Union Congress. The statement follows Mr. Murray's
presentation at the Prime Minister's meeting with the Economic
Committee last Monday very closely. But I would be grateful for
advice on whether the Prime Minister should send a substantive
reply. I have, of course, sent a formal acknowledgement.

I am sending copies of this letter to the Private Secretaries

PRIME MINISTER
As you know, I have to be at the Energy Ministers' meeting
in Luxembourg this morning when you are discussing the Hoskyns
Strategy Paper. I shall be putting in some personal comments
to John Hoskyns later in the week, but in the meantime may I
make the following brief points:

1. In my view the key to the whole Stepping Stones approach,
and to the achievement of a calmer and more stable economic
climate, has been all along to establish much more clearly in
workers' minds the nature of their real interests, in terms of
living standards, purchasing power, ownership of possessions,
and general status - as opposed to their 'interests' as
depicted and advanced by political (and muddled) union leaders.

2. The contract over the next fifteen months is going to
be particularly vivid - with the reality being an actual
through our tax and other policies
improvement/in the position of many workers ( especially skilled
groups such as miners and electricity workers who have been
the greatest threat in the past), but with union propagandists
focussing on the RPI figure and talking of 20% and 25% wage
increases to 'catch up'.

3. This is a battle of argument, understanding and presentation
which we have got to win in Round One (eg before August 1980)
otherwise we will continue to find ourselves (in Hoskyns' graphic",1979-06-17,SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY,PRIME MINISTER,Personal comments on Hoskyns Strategy Paper,letter,PREM 19-25/0001/-167.jpg,"Department for Energy, Security and Net Zero","The letter is addressed to the Secretary of State for Energy and discusses energy policy and the approach to engaging with energy workers and unions, which falls within the remit of the Department for Energy, Security and Net Zero.",1979-07-13

Dear Sir,

SUPPLY SIDE MEASURES

In reply to your letter of 19th June enclosing a
note of a meeting on Government strategy on 18th June.
The Chancellor has asked me to send you the attached list
of ideas for improving the supply side.   They include
not only Treasury suggestions but others deriving from
the work of sector working parties and inter-departmental
official discussions; but obviously, given the nature
of the exercise, they in no way represent a ""departmental
view"".

John Hoskyns' letter of 19th June asked for names of
possible speakers to help get the message of the Budget
over to trade unionists.   Possible names are Lord George
Brown, Lord Robens, Sir Richard Marsh and Sir Leonard
Neal.   However, the Chancellor wonders whether these
former trade union officials, however distinguished, are
likely to make much impact on the trade unions.   In his
view, the brunt will have to be borne by Ministers
addressing the public over the heads of trade union
leaders and employers appealing to their work forces over
the heads of militant shop stewards.   The CBI may be
able to help on this latter point.   I know that Treasury
Ministers have further ideas on this point, and I may well be
writing to amplify this paragraph after the Chancellor
returns from Tokyo.

The Role of the Institutional Investor

1. At the Prime Minister's recent meeting on Strategy there were a number of references to the need to encourage institutional investors to play a dynamic and constructive role in the affairs of the companies in which they invest.

2. The CPRS has interested itself in this area for the past seven years and has had numerous discussions with the financial institutions, with some of the companies they invest in, and with the Bank of England.

3. Over these years there has been some progress. In 1972 the institutions, particularly the insurance companies, were adamantly opposed to taking an active interest in particular companies. The tide is now flowing in the right direction but there are still many laggards. What the more dynamic institutions need is encouragement from Ministers which they can use to whip their more slow moving colleagues along.

10 DOWNING STREET

From the Principal Private Secretary			3 January 1980

Dear Tony,

When the Prime Minister saw the Chancellor of the Exchequer at 1430 this afternoon they discussed the following subjects.

Appointments at the Bank of England

The Prime Minister said that she had given careful consideration to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's minute of 31 December, 1979. She had told the Governor in December that she agreed very reluctantly to the proposal to appoint Mr. McMahon to be Deputy Governor in succession to Sir Jasper Hollom, but since then she had seen much more of the individuals concerned in connection with the question of Sir Jasper Hollom's position. In that context Sir Jasper Hollom had stood head and shoulders above all the other representatives of the Bank, including Mr. McMahon. He had shown himself to be both steady and decisive in a difficult situation. She had been surprised to learn that he was only 62, and she did not believe that we could afford to let him go. She would much prefer that rather than appoint Mr. McMahon, Sir Jasper Hollom should continue as Deputy Governor.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, following his talk with the Prime Minister, the Governor was now planning a number of staff appointments on the assumption that Mr. McMahon would become Deputy Governor, and it was likely that it would cause considerable difficulty if the earlier decision that Mr. McMahon should succeed Sir Jasper Hollom was now reversed. Personally, he thought better of Mr. McMahon than did the Prime Minister. Nonetheless, he would now see the Governor to let him know that the Prime Minister wished Sir Jasper Hollom to be kept on. It might be necessary for the Prime Minister to see Mr. Richardson herself. The Chancellor said that she was very ready to do this.

Clegg: Nurses' Pay

The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that the Press announcement about the Clegg award on nurses' pay should not contain any mention of increasing cash limits in order to accommodate the cost of the pay award, lest this should have repercussions on the present steel dispute. They agreed the lines of a form of words to be used, and we in this office are now pursuing the matter in separate correspondence.

Dear Geoffrey,

Following my letter of 20 February on the Budget, referring to getting the big numbers right, I did not mention council rents in the context of mortgages. It does seem that this is an area where, though I can see the difficulties, bold measures would make a huge difference. I realise this is rather academic now, but one could think of announcing a planned increase - or a range of increases - of rents, to bring them into line with the reality over 3 years - ie over TIME. Since they are ""tighteners"" not ""looseners"", the earlier you warn people, the better.

On the question of presentation, I was talking to David Howell today who was reiterating his concern that people didn't understand the impact of oil price rises on raw material prices and price levels generally. If, in last year's Budget, we had had the sort of presentation I suggested in my recent paper, with ""what if"" questions, we could then anticipate such external shocks, warning people in advance so that, if and when such shocks take place, you can refer back to the Budget presentation without appearing to make excuses.

We are really getting back to the question we discussed on the Pentiman day - the importance of establishing the criteria, at the beginning, by which people can judge what happens in the event. The Budget presentation could be a way of doing that, of helping people to understand that we live in an uncertain world. 

In the past, the convention is that Chancellors insult people's intelligence by treating them as if the world is certain, and the Chancellor is Father Christmas handing out goodies to a lot of goodies - you know the sort of thing, ""this year, I have tried to do a little more to help such and such a group"". It all sounds like ad hoc acts of charity with other people's money. We must use the Budget, like everything else, to educate people by treating them as adults, remembering that our target is the electoral margin.

REƒ
REVIEW OF CORPORATION TAX

I attach a note I wrote on 5 July.  I have no later information.

Clearly, if the Prime Minister is concerned that the tax system is in some way encouraging excessive company borrowing and pushing up interest rates, this should be fed into the Revenue's review.  However, it is not easy to draft a note for Number 10 without being certain what precise problem the Prime Minister has in mind.

Firstly there is the question of whether we actually have more borrowing than is desirable.  Others will be more competent to comment than I, but I had always understood British companies borrowed rather less than our more successful competitors.  I gather the Prime Minister's concern is that the tax system encourages companies to borrow more than they otherwise would, and that, if the money supply is to be held steady, this leads to interest rates higher than they would otherwise have been, which penalizes non-borrowers (especially mortgage payers).  It is important to bear in mind that if this effect exists it cannot be harming business investment.  Put another way, if a tax penalty is placed on borrowing firms will be forced to deal with bills which are as high as if the tax system had been left unchanged and interest rates had gone up.  So one is effectively penalizing firms to help house buyers.  Moreover, it must be doubtful in a world without exchange controls whether reducing UK company demand for funds will significantly reduce interest rates.

Perhaps more important for the Revenue, however, is to know what balancing adjustment we want companies to make to compensate for reduced borrowing.  They could reduce their investment - principally in capital assets or stocks.  I would not have thought we wanted to discourage capital investment;  I so",1974-07-05,SIR KENNETH BERRILL,"C Mr Downey

exactly the Budget that we, and the vast majority of
the people in the City, were hoping for. We believe
it gives industry and the City the opportunity to re-
build the country's financial strength which will, in
the end, enable us to hold up our heads again in this
competitive world. The short term reaction in the
market is to mark both Gilts and equities down.
This is only a symptom of the difficulties we know we
all have to face, probably in the autumn, but we are
certain that once industry has overcome these
temporary difficulties the future will look more
secure and the market will reflect these hopes.

Please lean on us if there is anything we can do
to help.

Meeting with the Chancellor

I imagine you will want to go over the public expenditure paper for Cabinet - including any further thoughts from the Chancellor on social security.  I enclose in this folder the material which I gave you for this evening's meeting with him and Mr. Jenkin.  One point which I have established is that the ERS could be abolished with effect from 1982 without any criticism that we were breaking the ""contribution contract"".  ERS contributions in Year 1 are assumed to pay for ERS benefits in Years 2 and 3 - i.e., it is not a funded scheme like a pension.

I have mentioned to the Treasury that you are very doubtful about the Chancellor's capital taxation proposals - simply because we won't have the money to pay for them.  They tell me that the Chancellor is also having second thoughts, and will almost certainly want to cut it down in size and scope.  In any case, final decisions on the package are not needed for quite a while.

Dear Mr Ivor,

Thank you for your letter of 6 June.

You raised first of all the question of indirect tax increases. You will now have heard the precise details of our Budget proposals. We have carried out our Election pledges to reduce substantially the burden of income tax: our cuts overall (in addition to those enacted by the 'caretaker' Finance Act in April) total £21 billion in 1979/80, and take an additional 1 million people out of the tax net.

To pay for these cuts, we have always made it clear that we would have to increase indirect taxation. We have concentrated these increases on VAT. VAT is not a regressive tax: it covers about one half of consumers' expenditure and does not apply to necessities like food, children's clothing, domestic heating and lighting, public transport and housing.

The other major indirect tax increase was in the duties on hydro-carbon oil. Clearly, in view of the current difficulties in oil supplies, we could not leave these duties unchanged, but we did exclude paraffin, which is widely used by the less well-off for domestic heating, from the increase. The duty on petrol is in any case not particularly regressive: the table attached (which is being published in the June Supplement to the Treasury's Economic Progress Report) shows that the petrol and VAT increases together will form a lower proportion of their expenditure for those on lower incomes.

I hope this explanation helps to clarify the position. Please let me know if you have any other queries.

Yours sincerely,",1979-06-21,"10 Downing Street, The Prime Minister",Mr Ivor,Explanation of indirect tax increases in the Budget,Letter,PREM 19-175/0001/-181.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses government fiscal policy, including changes to taxation such as VAT and duties on hydro-carbon oil, which fall under the remit of HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry.",1979-07-19
"Confederation of British Industry
From the Director General, Sir John Methven
To the Managing Director or Chief Executive

Dear Member,

Over the last three years, I have written to all of you on a regular basis, explaining in my own words what I believe that the CBI had achieved and the objectives I thought we should be striking out for.

I had intended to use this letter as a normal report to you all.  But that I now think would be wrong.  This letter needs to be straightforward and to the point, and I would ask you all to read it and then discuss it with your colleagues throughout your organisation.  My reason for asking this is as follows:

Every one of us knows that we are entering a crucial period in the UK.  We have a Government which, in its Budget, has set out to do many of the things that on the personal incentives front we have so long argued for.  They have taken risks, but they have been bold and courageous.  They have been bold in dealing with the Price Commission.  I believe too, that they intend to move firmly on the Industrial Relations front.  If they don't, they will get pushed very sharply by the CBI!

So at last we have a Government which is intent on giving us - managers, employers and shopfloor - many of the conditions for which we have asked; and they are going to ask us all - as they are entitled to - how we are going to respond.

How can we - each of us - respond? At its meeting on Wednesday last week the CBI Council responded by passing the following resolution (and the CBI Council very rarely passes resolutions!):

'This Council fully supports the strategy and the direction of the Budget and recognises that its success will hinge to a large extent on the ability of managers and employees throughout business to respond to the challenge and the incentives it provides.  The CBI Council therefore calls on all CBI member firms to do everything in their power through the efficient and competitive management of their enterprises to ensure that the policies, which the CBI has long advocated and which are now being pursued by the Government, lead to higher productivity, higher living standards, more jobs and a more successful economy, in the interests of the British people as a whole.'

The CBI, as I well know, has no power or right, of its own initiative, to make promises on behalf of its membership.  It is not something I would ever attempt.  But we have learned to act and fight together over the last three years when it matters most.  And it matters most now.",1979-06-28,Sir John Methven,Managing Director or Chief Executive,Confederation of British Industry - letter from Director General,Letter,PREM 19-175/0001/-168.jpg,Department for Business and Trade,"The letter is from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents businesses in the UK.

encourage men and women at all levels in industry to
produce the extra effort and the initiatives which
are essential to this country's economic revival.

3.	Management in the motor industry will certainly play
its part in striving for the improved productivity
and international competitiveness which are vital
to the industry's recovery.

4.	We look forward to a new relationship between industry
and Government in which Government does not seek to
intervene in the day-to-day management of industry, but:-

- spells out clearly what is expected from all
concerned with industry, including both manage-
ment and trade unions;

- identifies and agrees with industry the economic
objectives to be pursued within the UK economy
and in our international trading relationships; and

- recognises industrial efficiency and growth as a

Dear Tan,

RATE SUPPORT GRANT 1979-80

The Prime Minister asked how the £35 million for the reduction in the R80 cash limit for Scotland had been calculated.

2. You will remember that the proposal put to Cabinet was that the R80 cash limit for England and Wales should be reduced by £200 million, and that this should be offset by reducing the Scottish cash limit by the same proportion as £200 million bears to the cash limit for England and Wales. This gave a figure of £35 million. The Scots argued for calculating the reduction on the 1979/80 ratio which is used for dealing with the England and Wales:Scotland shares of comparable R80 programmes, which would have given a cut of £22 million for the Scots. As a compromise, which the Scots accepted, the figure of £35 million was put to Cabinet.

3. In fact Cabinet agreed that the cut for England and Wales should be £700 million, which would have given a figure proportionately, of £374 million for Scotland. With the agreement of the Scots, this was rounded down to £35 million because, given the underlying calculation, a figure of £374 million would have looked too precise and would have been difficult to justify publicly. In fact, as you will see, £35 million comes very close to the 19.10 ratio mentioned above.",1979-06-11,"Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street",T P Lankester Esq,Rate Support Grant 1979-80,Letter,PREM 19-175/0001/-215.jpg,HM Treasury,"The letter discusses details of the UK government's budget and funding for rate support grants, which falls under the remit of HM Treasury as the ministry responsible for economic and financial policy.",1979-07-09

The Prime Minister has expressed concern about the current provisions for corporate stock relief. Her impression is that it has a distorting influence on company behaviour in that companies tend to increase their stocks unnecessarily at the end of the financial year, and this also results in a loss to the Exchequer. I would be grateful if you could let me have comments on this point. It would be helpful if you could also let me know what are the Chancellor's plans for reviewing Corporation Tax generally: the Prime Minister has expressed the view that Corporation Tax has become an ""optional tax"", and she thinks that consideration should be given either to abolishing it altogether or to making it operative.

The Prime Minister has also asked what progress is being made in devising a ""standard of living"" index, which will include tax as part of the cost of living.

As a separate matter your letter also said that the Prime Minister had asked what progress was being made in devising a 'standard of living' index, which will include tax as part of the cost of living.

Corporation tax and stock relief

The Chancellor has already set in hand a wide-ranging review of the corporation tax system.

Although stock relief has undoubtedly provided a good deal of help for industry, it is true that it is rough and ready and can to some extent be manipulated.  For this reason it is already being looked at as part of the review; the Chancellor will certainly take account of the Prime Minister's observations.

Meanwhile, it would be wrong to underestimate the effectiveness of the corporation tax, although it is clearly uneven in its present form.  It yielded nearly £4 billion in 1978-79, and is forecast to rise to nearly £5 billion in the current year.  Certainly, it has been less buoyant than income tax.  But this was in some aspects inevitable, with company profitability as low in real terms as it has been recently.  Corporation tax remains the third largest revenue-raiser, after income tax and VAT.

Before bringing forward any proposals for change, the Chancellor will be consulting both with colleagues and with outside interests; and he will, of course, in due course be reporting to the Prime Minister.

Dear John,

I thought I would drop you a line and let you know
something of the general feeling in the Debenhams Group as a
result of the new Budget.

First, and I am writing with restraint; there was
a strong surge of patriotic feeling went through the senior
management as the realisation sank in that here at last was
a Government acting in the best interests of the country.
With this came a determination to make the Budget work.
Here are a few of the things we have decided to do as a result:-

1.	The increase in V.A.T. has left us in some
confusion about our sales; margins and stock
planning for the future.	The one point,
however, which comes out most clearly is the
grave danger of a drop in unit sales with
resultant price increases throughout the
Group.	We have, therefore, as a matter of
urgengy, instituted a review of all our
sources of supply to ensure that the axe falls
most gently on the suppliers, particularly in
the U.K., with whom we wish to have growing
long term relations.	This means, of course,
a cruel blow to a number of fringe people;
but we take the view that in any case one of
our problems as a country is that we have too
many fringe activities.

2.	Although we regard ourselves as the lowest cost
Department Store Group in the world, we have
instituted another look at all our costs,
particularly those associated with the burea–
cracy, both our own and that of Whitehall which,
as you know, imposes on us heavy demands for
paper returns, etc.	We are going to perform
surgery with zest.	I look forward to the first
confrontation with some Whitehall Department

In the letter to you of 21 June, the President said that we would be writing to all CBI members urging them to respond to the new climate that you and your Government created by the Budget.

I now enclose a copy of the letter which I have just sent out. We shall be publicizing individual examples of actions taken by companies and management in the new climate. I have mentioned T R Z Wheal Jane in the letter to members and I also enclose a copy of the letter that I have had from Bob Thornton, Chief Executive of Debenhams, which arose from a conversation which I had with him and to which, I am sure that you will agree, he has responded in the fullest fashion.

We will also be publishing shortly a note which should help managers to resist wage claims based on the RPI: and I will send that to you, if I may. I am sure that you will agree that it is absolutely essential that we all get over to the public in every possible way over the next two months the fact that people really will have more money in their pockets and that excessive wage claims pushed through by the unions, will, in the absence of much higher productivity, only lead to higher inflation and further loss of jobs. I hope that you will agree that we might discuss this information problem as one of the topics at the meeting on 9 July.",1979-06-28,"Sir John Methven, Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry","The Rt Hon Mrs Margaret Thatcher MP, Prime Minister",Response to the new climate created by the Government's Budget,Letter,PREM 19-175/0001/-167.jpg,"Prime Minister's Office, No. 10 Downing Street","The letter is addressed directly to the Prime Minister and discusses the government's economic policies and their impact on businesses, which falls under the responsibility of the Prime Minister's Office.",1979-07-26

Dear Tim,

TIMETABLE FOR MAIN DECISIONS ON THE BUDGET ETC

As promised, I enclose a copy of our ""master"" timetable for the Budget and related matters. This will give you an idea of how we see the various decisions moving forward, including the possible financial plan we had a brief word about.

2. This is in a sense an ideal timetable and the facts of life will no doubt ensure that there are slippages. But there is not much room for slippage if we are to avoid severe pressure at the later stages.

3. I should welcome a further word with you on the question of consultation with the Prime Minister. My own advice to the Chancellor has been that he ought to open up with the Prime Minister as early as possible during the week beginning Monday 18 February. There is also the question of the Budget Cabinet. Declassification of certain occupations may rule out 25 March; but for a variety of reasons the Prime Minister may not, I suppose, want to hold it any earlier. However, if it is to be held on Budget morning itself, we should have to be pretty certain that the risk of changes was negligible.

4. Perhaps we could arrange a word when you have had a chance to look at this. I should, of course, be very grateful if you would regard it as for your personal information only.

Yours

CORPORATE TAXATION

Following our discussion on corporate taxation with Messrs Hoskyn and Strauss,
I rang the Revenue (Mr Isaac) to see exactly what the scope of their review would be.
The Revenue have not yet discussed this with the Chancellor and are in the process of
putting up a note to him asking for guidance. One issue is whether to change the
imputation system (giving credit to the shareholder at the basic rate for corporation
tax paid by the company). The Revenue do not believe any conceivable benefits would
be worth the cost of change. Companies certainly would not welcome another speical
in the structure of the tax (? previous ones in 1965 and 1972).

The other issue is that the correct measure of profits is. This raises
questions like -

1. Should the tax base be adjusted to the ED 24 inflation-adjusted definition
   of profits? (How does this fit in with the treatment of inflation in
   other areas of the tax system?)

2. Should capital allowances remain at 100% in the first year?
   Should they be based on replacement costs rather than historic costs?

3. What is the future of stock appreciation relief?

The Chancellor had laid down as a prerequisite of any system of inflation
adjustment that it should be objective, equitable and simple to administer.

The Revenue thought the first stage was to get Treasury Ministers' views.
The Chancellor would then have to discuss with the Prime Minister which other
Ministers should get involved and how. The Revenue did not believe it could be
helpful to put Treasury Ministers' decisions in commission although there would have
to be consultation of colleagues and, in due course, of outside interested bodies.

It was particularly important to avoid the chase of the last ten days over the
Secretary of State for the Environment's initiative. It emerged that there was no
question of the Treasury rather than the Inland Revenue taking the lead.",1979-07-05,M A JOHNS,"cc Sir Kenneth Berrill

Dear Geoffrey,

As you consider the balance and main constituents of the Budget, you may wish to have a note of the industrial position as I see it, and the priorities I favour.

This letter is, of course, written without benefit of the latest National Income Forecast now being formulated. I share your reservations about the situation, especially in present conditions, and I understand that you want to keep the forecast to as minute a circle as possible at this time. Nevertheless, I hope you will agree that I may see the forecasts submitted to you, as I did last Summer though not in the Autumn.  I should not be surprised if the forecast indicated a significantly higher earnings and price level increases than in the Industry Act Forecast, and a substantially sharper fall in GDP and - more especially - in manufacturing output. The consequences of such trends for corporate liquidity would be very serious and I return to that below.

I understand and strongly share your concern at the likely side of the PSBR, which will be aggravated by the effects of the steel strike, by the adverse trends in earnings, prices and activity suggested above, if they materialise, and by the lower expected output from the North Sea. The effects on interest rates if a PSBR of £10-11bn had to be financed would be deeply worrying.   I assume from our discussions in Cabinet that the greater part, if not the whole, of the further public expenditure cuts together with sales of assets and any reduction in our EBQ contribution will go to reduce the PSBR; and that there will be little if any headroom for net tax reductions - indeed quite possibly the reverse.

The corporate liquidity situation seems to me of pivotal importance. Pressure on corporate liquidity is, of course, one of the mechanisms by which our monetary policy is intended to operate in inflation expectations and wage demands. But there may come a point at which that pressure entails unacceptable damage in two areas - the chances of survival of potentially viable parts of our industrial structure (which we must be careful not to jeopardise), and the stability of the financial system itself. I return to that also below.

"We estimate that in 1977 there were 900,000 dwellings with 5 or more 'separate' bedrooms. We are determined to encourage as many home owners as possible to let their rooms and thus combat housing shortages. Two main changes are proposed to boost resident landlordlettings and tap the sub-stantial pool of under-used accommodation in owner-occupied homes. The first is that for new lettings a notice to quit may no longer be suspended by the rent tribunal and no possession order may be postponed for more than 3 months. Second, a landlord will be able to grant consecutive fixed-term tenancies without creating fully protected tenancies. One remaining disincentive to letting, however, is the continuing threat to resident landlords of liability for CGT on the sale of their homes - they are not treated as businessmen when it comes to claiming capital allowances, yet the situation is reversed as soon as there is a possibility of sharing capital gains tax. The estimated cost of exemption from CGT for resident landlords is minimal i.e. £0.5m, yet its psychological impact would be great. In addition the public expenditure costs will be reduced each time a landlord who would otherwise be on the local authorities' waiting list. For example the present cost of providing a local authority home for 2 people is £8,000. On the other hand, if such a couple were to be housed by a resident landlord the net result could be a gain to the public purse of income tax on the rent received. I would be grateful if you could let me have your initial views on the possibilities of this exemption, particularly as the matter is quite likely to be raised again during the course of the Housing Bill, following Nick Scott's reference to it on Second Reading and given the steady amount of correspondence we have received on this issue. You will appreciate that our continuing inactivity looks all the weaker given the fact that before the General Election both Nigal Lawson and Hugh Rossi expressed their support for the proposal.

My dear Bote,

I thought I should write to you today to let you
know why I am having to present my Budget on the day of
your enthronement, and to assure you - not that I suppose
for a moment that you would think otherwise - that I am
not engaged in a dark conspiracy to distract attention
from the Canterbury installation.  I should have liked
nothing better than to witness your great day.

The problem, which I imagine you understand very well
already, is that a Chancellor has in practice very little
room for manoeuvre in his choice of Budget Day.  The sheer
mechanics of the operation - the physical production of
the speech, final consultations with colleagues and so
on - make Tuesday very much the best day, as successive
Chancellors have found.

But even if Tuesday is based on much more than
tradition, why pick on your Tuesday? Ironically enough
my choice has been very much influenced by the dictates of
the ecclesiastical calendar.  We need to set the Budget
date as close as possible to the end of March;  delays could
mean lost revenue, while advancing the date means that we
are without important information about the year just gone.
With the Tuesday before Easter, and the two succeeding
Tuesdays more or less ruled out, 25th March was in effect
our only option.

The problem does become a little easier in years when
Easter is late.  My impression is that Easter in the
Orthodox Church is never earlier than in Western Christendom,

Dear Tom,

ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE DATE OF THE BUDGET

As you will be aware, the Prime Minister has agreed to the Chancellor's proposal that the date of the Budget should be Tuesday, 25th March. As you know, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor last Thursday had a brief discussion about the best date for announcing this, in light of the fact that it coincides with the date of installation of the new Archbishop of Canterbury.

The Chancellor has now considered this further and has concluded that there is no good reason for holding back on an announcement. In these circumstances the Chancellor feels that it would be sensible for him to tell Cabinet about the date of the Budget next Thursday, 17th January, and have an announcement in Parliament that afternoon.

The usual method for making the announcement in Parliament is for the Leader of the House to give the information in reply to a question by the Leader of the Opposition (prompted by the Chief Whip) on the Thursday Business Statement. It would seem sensible to follow this course next Thursday.

I am copying this letter to John Stevens and Murdo Maclean.
