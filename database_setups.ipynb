They had a wide-ranging discussion. The following is a summary of some of the points covered.\\n\\nThe Domestic Monetary Situation\\n\\nThe Governor said that the monetary prospect was now a little more encouraging. This was for three reasons. First, the Government\\'s funding requirements would be rather lower over the next few months. Secondly, while lending to the private sector was still strong, there were signs that it might begin to edge down soon. Some of the recent lending had been to finance early repayment of foreign currency loans, and this had increased the level of total lending over what it otherwise would have been. Thirdly, the August figures for lending to persons suggested that this category of lending was beginning to moderate.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there were several anxieties. In the first place, there was the engineering dispute, which was causing uncertainty in the market. Secondly, it was still possible that lending to the private sector would continue at a high level - especially if corporate liquidity worsened in response to big pay settlements. Thirdly, there was concern that sterling might fall further. Insofar as this would worsen the inflationary outlook, this would make gilt sales that much more difficult. Finally, there was pressure from rising interest rates overseas.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister asked whether, against this background, interest rates were likely to fall in time to avoid the increase in the mortgage rate in January. The Governor responded that, although the outlook was very uncertain, it seemed more likely that interest rates would stay up than that they would turn down soon enough.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister then asked whether it would not be possible to tighten the \"corset\" in order to hold back bank lending. The Governor explained that while the \"corset\" arrangements could in principle be changed so as to eliminate the existing leakages, the banks and borrowers would almost certainly find new ways of evading the controls. For example, inter-company lending would probably increase. There might also be increased borrowing from abroad. Ultimately, the authorities had to rely on interest rates to bring the level of credit creation to the private sector within the desired limits.'}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter is addressed to the Treasury Chambers and discusses figures related to the money supply and bank lending, which fall under the remit of the HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry.\", 'Departments': 'HM Treasury', 'date': '1979-10-08', 'document-type': 'Letter', 'id': 7, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-34_0001_-184.jpg', 'recipient': 'T.

The Chancellor thought that the Prime Minister might like to be aware of the provisional full figures, which will be published on Thursday week, 18th October, since it is possible that the market will read more into them than is justified.\\n\\nAs the attached note brings out, it would be risky to conclude that this is the first sign of a turndown in the bank lending figures. It may be, but it is risky to conclude this on the strength of one month's figures alone. First, the underlying reduction is probably not as much as the published figures suggest. Second, there have been monthly fluctuations in the underlying figures - in both directions - of at least as much as this in the recent past. The Chancellor will let the Prime Minister know what implications he draws for monetary policy when he has had a chance of considering these figures and the new financial forecasts with the Governor.\\n\\nI am sending a copy of this letter to John Beverly at the Bank.\\n\\nYours ever,\\n\\n(A.M.W.

I suggest that you should not suggest or even hint at the possibility of a further review of public expenditure for 1980-81: that could lead to defensive counter-briefing by Ministers who saw their programmes as threatened. But perhaps we do need to begin to prepare for the possibility of having to make further cuts in expenditure for 1980-81, if over the coming few months it is not possible to regain control of the monetary targets by the measures now proposed. I believe that it would be useful for you privately to ask the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary, strictly within the Treasury, to review the programmes for 1980-81 with a view to identifying options for further cuts, if further cuts had to be made. It would be useful if they could report on the results of such an exercise by Friday, 7th December, so that it would be available if needed in the following week - the week before you go to the United States.\"}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter discusses monetary policy, which falls under the remit of HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry.\", 'Departments': 'HM Treasury', 'date': '1979-11-07', 'document-type': 'Letter', 'id': 10, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-34_0001_-159.jpg', 'recipient': 'Mr Littler', 'sender': 'E K.

It funds and guides the activities of 12 international agricultural research centres with the object of increasing\\nfood production in the developing world. The Group was established\\nin 1971, under the co-sponsorship of the International Bank for\\nReconstruction and Development, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the United Nations Development Programme when it assumed\\nfinancial responsibility for the four original centres launched by\\nthe Ford and Rockefeller Foundations (which remain among the contributors). The UK and the US were both founder members of the\\nGroup, which has grown rapidly to its present size. It has a total\\nbudget in 1979 of $US104 million. The UK contribution in 1979 is\\n£3 million - about 6% of the total. The US has traditionally contributed 25% of total requirements.\\n\\nThe work of the research centres funded by the CGIAR has\\nachieved important successes in raising the yield potential of some\\nof the world's major crops including rice, wheat and maize and the\\nConsultative Group itself has been an economical mechanism for\\nattracting funds and of guiding and coordinating the work of the\\nresearch centres. However, this mechanism was established at the\\ninception of the Group to meet the needs of a fairly modest\\norganisation and we believe it could benefit from some revision\\nbefore the present rate of expansion can be accelerated with confidence. It also needs to do more to help developing countries'\\nown research organisations to adapt the work of the centres to\\nlocal needs: this is in hand and we think has the highest priority\\nin any expansion.\\n\\nWhen the Consultative Group meets in Washington at the end of\\nOctober we do not expect to be able to increase the UK pledge in\\nreal terms, or to make a firm commitment to a five-year plan.

President Giscard d'Estaing had telephoned Helmut Schmidt to seek support for his suggestion that there should be review meetings in the late summer and the autumn by the Energy Ministers of the seven Tokyo summit countries of the progress towards meeting the targets that had been set by the summit.  Schmidt's response had basically been to accept this proposal providing that it did not create a special club outside the OECD and EEC.  He thought it was important not to institutionalise the Tokyo summit, but he had no objection to reviewing its results on a regular basis.  The Secretary of State agreed with this line and said that he would wish to discuss it with his Cabinet colleagues.  I would be grateful for your advice on how we should proceed in following up this exchange.\\n\\n3.  In further discussion Count Lambsdorff said that he had received no report from M.

Earlier contacts with the Saudis had convinced him that they would acquiesce in the Camp David Agreements. The US had put much effort into maintaining close links with the Saudis and in assisting them in the defence and intelligence fields.

If this is not done, then we shall find that the options which have been identified are inadequate to meet our broad objective of bringing the total of public expenditure back to the 1977-78 level over the lifetime of the present Parliament, while permitting us a limited degree of choice and some modest increase in programmes.'}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter discusses public expenditure, cuts, and spending reductions, which fall under the remit of HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry responsible for managing public spending.\", 'Departments': 'HM Treasury', 'date': '1979-06-07', 'document-type': 'Letter', 'id': 50, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-19_0001_-183.jpg', 'recipient': 'Rt Hon George Younger TD MP, Secretary of State, Scottish Office', 'sender': 'John Biffen', 'source': 'PREM 19-19/0001/-183.jpg', 'subject': 'Response to letter about economic outlook for Scotland and public expenditure cuts', 'text': 'Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street, SWIP 3AG\\n\\nRt Hon George Younger TD MP\\nSecretary of State\\nScottish Office\\nDover House\\nWhitehall\\nLondon SW1A 2AU\\n\\n7th June 1979\\n\\nDear George,\\n\\nThank you for your letter of 24 May addressed to Geoffrey Howe about the economic outlook for Scotland.

It seems to me in the light of this that we must still be looking at what we do with child benefits at the same time as we consider the level of tax allowances.\\n\\nHowever, it is not the form, but the substance, with which I am concerned.  I understand the argument that now that Family Allowances and Child Tax Allowances have been fully merged to form Child Benefit with no residual tax allowance, one should cease looking back and saying that some part of what is being paid as a benefit should be \"counted\" as a tax allowance.  But to accept this as \"the form\" without regard to the substance could be to lose sight of important factors.  It is a fact that if the cost of the child tax allowances in their last full year (1976-1977) had been updated in line with other personal tax allowances, the existing level would, I understand, \\'cost\\' something like £1.9 billion a year (or two-thirds of the total cost of child benefit) none of which would be regarded as public expenditure.\\n\\nWhat concerns me is that we should achieve a recognition that, (unless and until we move towards a full tax-credit scheme, when the whole question how we should handle the ensuing provision for public expenditure purposes will arise) two factors should be fully recognised in everyone\\'s thinking:-\\n\\na.\\tThere is now only one way of helping families with children, instead of two:  Child Benefit replaces both Child Tax Allowances and Family Allowances, and'}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter discusses the government's policy on civil service staff costs and cash limits, which falls under the remit of the Cabinet Office as it supports the overall running of government.\", 'Departments': 'Cabinet Office', 'date': '1979-05-31', 'document-type': 'Letter', 'id': 66, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-19_0001_-174.jpg', 'recipient': 'Unknown', 'sender': 'Prime Minister', 'source': 'PREM 19-19/0001/-174.jpg', 'subject': '1979-80 Cash Limits: Civil Service Wages and Salaries', 'text': 'CONFIDENTIAL\\n\\nPRIME MINISTER\\n\\n1979-80 CASH LIMITS: CIVIL SERVICE WAGES AND SALARIES\\n\\nWhen I mentioned in Cabinet the other day that I was worried about our prospects of achieving the 3% cut in civil service staff costs in 1979-80, your view was that the important thing was to save the money, and that whether the saving was in manpower or in other expenditure mattered less.  We are however publicly committed to the target figure of a 3% reduction in the pay component in cash limits, as compared with the figure of at least 2% which the last Government was known to be planning.  When we decided on 3%, I felt that it was the least we should go for though the most we would get, and I believe that you shared that view.\\n\\n2.  Our conclusion in Cabinet on 17 May provided that if any Minister found it impossible to achieve 3% in his department, he could suggest to the Chief Secretary alternative ways of finding the money.  As these claims began to come in, and others were rumoured, I started to worry about what this was all going to amount to, and I told Willie Whitelaw and our other colleagues in my letter of 30 May that we should have to review the aggregate before taking final decisions, and that I might have to ask colleagues to think again.  For any figure appreciably less than 3% would expose us to charges of failing to deliver and of a poor and unconvincing start to our campaign to reduce the size of the Civil Service.\\n\\n3.  The claims I have now received confirm my worst fears.  We have throughout taken the view that we should have to exempt the staff in prisons and places like Rampton.  The cost of that, together with one or two other very small exceptions in the field of law and order, reduces the 3% to 2.6% - a figure which we could perhaps just about live with.  The real trouble arises with the arrangement which we have agreed for the social security staff in DHSS, and the likely repercussions of that arrangement on other departments which also employ sizeable staffs on the reduction of fraud and abuse in benefits or taxes: the Department of Employment, the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise.\\n\\n4.  The arrangement for DHSS will of itself reduce the figure of 2.8% to 2.5%.  Jim Prior has however said that he would feel bound to press for a similar arrangement in the Department of Employment, and I understand that a strong pressure may also arise in the Inland Revenue and the Customs, where the diversion of possible staff savings into work on fraud and evasion would also produce monetary gains much greater than the staff costs.  My officials estimate that if those departments made savings which were proportionately no greater than those proposed for DHSS, the saving in the cash limits would come down to 2%.'}, {'Department_Justification': 'The Cabinet Office supports the Prime Minister and ensures the effective running of government.

As you say, discussions have been going on between our two departments at official level on this matter. A sale would be opposed by the Covent Garden Market Authority, and there are various other complications to be resolved (some of which might involve expenditure before we can realise the proceeds from the sale).

The Barrier accounts for a very large proportion of my department's total expenditure. Its annual cost cannot be cut back without extenting the period during which London will be at risk of a flood which could cause loss of life and damage running into billions. But it has nothing whatever to do with agriculture, fisheries or food, and it is absolutely wrong that these industries should be asked to make disproportionate sacrifices to pay for the cost of protecting London. In my view expenditure on the Barrier should be regarded as analogous to defence expenditure - the risk it defends London from is quite as immediate as the risk of war - and should therefore be exempt from the current or future savings exercises.\\n\\nThe sale of Market Towers will however make it possible for us to give hill sheep producers on higher land the increased aid they desperately need to cope with their heavy losses and much higher costs this year because of the hard winter, while still effecting a large net saving to public funds.

In their dialogue with Japan her partners have generally pressed four requests: the stimulation of domestic demand, the further liberalisation of the Japanese market, the appreciation of the yen (all of these designed to bring down the surplus on current account) and an increase in aid and other net long-term capital outflows.\\n\\n3.

At Cabinet on 17 May, the Prime Minister accepted my point that we needed a measure of discretion, in cutting our manpower costs, to make sure that we did not put at risk much larger sums of public expenditure. This applies particularly to the administration of social security benefits, where reductions in staff numbers could prevent the realisation of savings through proper checking of benefit entitlement and the prevention of fraud and abuse. Cabinet agreed that Ministers who found it impossible to achieve the agreed 3 per cent level of saving on wage-related expenditure could suggest to you alternative ways of securing equivalent savings (cc(79)2nd meeting).\\n\\n2. My task, under the Cabinet decision, is to achieve a saving of about £12.5 million in the current financial year. I am fully prepared to go for savings in staff numbers beyond the 3 per cent limit at DHSS headquarters and in our large central and regional offices. By this means I should achieve a financial saving of the order of £7 million (equivalent to about 1,380 staff). To reduce staff numbers in our local offices would weaken control over benefit payments and reduce measures against fraud and abuse, resulting in higher payments which might more than cancel out the staff savings. This would not be sensible in any circumstances; and it would fly in the face of our manifesto commitments to cut out waste and tackle fraud and abuse more vigorously.\\n\\n3. What I propose to do therefore is to strengthen our staff engaged (mainly in local offices) in checking fraud and abuse by up to 1,000 posts, and thus make savings in benefit expenditure of the order of £12 million in this financial year and achieve continuing savings of as much as £50 million a year in subsequent years. I am satisfied that this can be done on the basis of the information we have about the average amount of benefit saved by each officer employed on investigating fraud.'}, {'Department_Justification': 'The letter is from the Secretary of State for the Department of Education and Science, discussing matters related to public expenditure cuts and the announcement of the Chancellor.

This is a £150 million more than in your earlier proposals.\\n\\nI am of course anxious to do everything possible to help you to achieve the larger target for total savings in 1979-80 which you have now set. I must however make the point that my Department's programmes are being asked to find a disproportionate share of the total. I understand that you are seeking a reduction of about 5% in total expenditure (excluding defence and law and order). A 3% reduction in this Department's programmes would produce only about £60 million.\\n\\nSo in my view the much larger cuts I shall be suggesting in this letter should only be made if all our other colleagues can also meet in full the revised targets you have set them, so clearly the way for the really substantial budget tax cuts that are needed to give industry new impetus and incentive.\\n\\nIf I am to save as much as £150 million more in 1979-80, I must find the largest part from the Regional Development Grants scheme. Since grants are paid some time in arrears the only way in which a large saving can be made in the short term is to impose a moratorium on payments. Our predecessors did this in 7/78 and the strong objections that were expressed still apply. In particular, a four month moratorium will deprive industry of an inflow of £30 million on which they will have been relying in their cash flow forecasts and it will be only a postponement of Government expenditure rather than a real cut. Nevertheless I can see no other way of finding immediate savings of anything approaching this scale. A moratorium will not be seen as the last word on changes in the Regional Aid package and it will be important to reach early conclusions on the future shape of that policy.\"}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter is from the Principal Private Secretary at 10 Downing Street, which is the official residence and office of the British Prime Minister.

I have personally been through the various items of expenditure in these two areas. I have also discussed the various possibilities for cuts in the grant-in-aid with the Chairman of the MSC who had been mandated by the full Commission to act on their behalf.

In other words, my approach has not been to find cuts amounting to the lower figure but to cut back those programmes which I thought could be cut back to the maximum extent possible. This has not been carried through without a great deal of thought, pain and grief.\\n\\nI have tried to be rigorous on this, assuming other colleagues will be too, despite the damaging effects on unemployment in the short term. The effect on unemployment was a main consideration I had in mind, but it is not possible to cut expenditure on the Department of Employment's vote without producing an effect on unemployment.

I am to have a standing shortly with Keith Joseph to discuss regional policy but I am concerned that any forthcoming changes in policy should be seen against the wider economic background.\\n\\nThe various economic forecasts for the UK economy, though differing in detail, all agree that unemployment during 1979 is likely to rise. In part this is a consequence of the low growth rate in world trade, and in part the result of our own weak export performance stemming from the combination of a strong and stable currency with rising unit costs of production; but the result is that economic growth in the UK is unlikely to match the economies' natural growth in productive potential so that there will be an increasing surplus of unemployed labour.\\n\\nRecent economic performance in Scotland has, if anything, been slightly weaker than for the UK as a whole; and with a serious situation affecting a number of our major industries, notably shipbuilding, we would expect this weaker performance also to be a feature of the year ahead. With seasonally adjusted unemployment in Scotland now at 7.5%, this means that levels of between 8 and 10% for Scotland as a whole, and much higher in difficult areas such as Strathclyde, are quite probable next winter without any change in existing policies.\\n\\nThere is of course very widespread concern over unemployment in Scotland, particularly in Strathclyde, and over the difficulties faced by some of our major industries. There is no doubt that this was a major factor in the Scottish election results and I have made it clear publicly that I attach the highest priority to bringing the level of unemployment down. For the longer term can in no doubt reduced levels of direct taxation and a reduction in the cost of finance for industries through lower interest rates can a one-requisite for fostering entrepreneurship and stronger economic growth. But the benefits of these measures will take time to work through. In the short term increased personal disposable income as a result of tax reductions is likely, particularly with the present strong exchange rate, to result in increased imports of consumption goods, while the offsetting reductions in public expenditure which we must make will necessarily give rise to higher levels of unemployment.\"}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter discusses public expenditure and reductions in government spending, which falls under the remit of HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry responsible for maintaining control over public spending.\", 'Departments': 'HM Treasury', 'date': '1979-05-23', 'document-type': 'Letter', 'id': 154, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-18_0001_-84.jpg', 'recipient': 'The Rt Hon John Biffen MP', 'sender': 'MICHAEL HESELTINE', 'source': 'PREM 19-18/0001/-84.jpg', 'subject': 'PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1979/80', 'text': 'CONFIDENTIAL\\n\\nPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1979/80\\n\\nThank you for your letter of 21 May.\\n\\nI am content to find reductions in expenditure amounting to £45m as you propose, above the cash limit savings.

They will be reporting to me later this week their assessment of the means and implications of finding £500 million from the BNOC and £200 million from the BGC. Both are not unexpectedly hostile to the idea of such operations. Notwithstanding, I believe that progress can be made in meeting your request. However the policy of selling state assets raises issues of wider Government policy, going beyond the interests of my Department, and I consider that our Cabinet colleagues should have at least a brief opportunity of discussing those issues when they consider tomorrow your proposals for public expenditure reductions in 1979/80. \\n\\nFirst, specific decisions to dispose of BNOC's and BGC's assets taken in the immediate context of the Budget statement will not, of course, give us time to consider thoroughly the implications for our strategy for the nationalised industries and for the scope for introducing private shareholding generally. An immediate selling operation is likely to benefit mainly the few companies which are well placed, through their partnerships in the oilfields in question or for some other reason. This raises the important issue of our objectives for wider personal ownership, including shares in public sector industries where there is scope for this.\"}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter discusses additional funding needed for the defence budget, including for naval requirements, contract refitting of ships, and increases in planned spending on air systems.

So far as the other 5.1m is concerned, I have considered again whether it would be practicable to increase the cuts I originally proposed for the Research Councils and universities in the current financial year; but I fear that after very careful scrutiny of existing commitments, I feel that there no is scope for doing so. This leaves only two areas where further savings might be made.\\n\\nThe first of these is in further and higher education fees. Our predecessors announced in March a 9 percent increase in these fees from September to maintain their real value. A further increase of 20 percent would yield about £5m in 1979-80.

In replying, I also comment on some ideas Keith Joseph\\nput forward in a minute to the Prime Minister of the same date.\\n\\nThe only sure way by which employees can avoid the risk of an\\narbitrator coming to an award beyond their ability to pay is to\\nstand on their final offer and refuse to accept that an independent\\nthird party should be invited to determine their pay bill. If\\nemployers accept arbitration, on any practical test they are committed\\nto accept the outcome. Uniquely in the public sector there are\\nprocedural agreements which provide unilateral access to arbitration\\nand I readily agree that, provided with this option, unions might\\nwell choose to discover whether an arbitrator might make an award\\nabove the employer's last offer rather than conclude a negotiated\\nsettlement.\\n\\nThe immediate issue with which you are concerned clearly illustrates the\\npoint. The local authority employers, under their freely negotiated\\narbitration agreement, have agreed - albeit reluctantly - that the union\\ncan put the pay claim to Arbitration. Should they not be urgently considering, given the extent of their\\nconcerns, changing their agreement? This is the main issue to which the paper\\nwhich I have put to G Committee on Arbitration in the public services\\nis addressed. It is important to note that S.3 of the Employment\\nProtection Act 1975 prevents ACAS from referring any dispute to\\narbitration without the consent of all the parties to that dispute.\\n\\nAs to your suggestions, I entirely agree that an arbitrator should take\\nfully into account an employer's ability to pay, although the concept of\\nwhat that might be does not always afford an absolute test. Even where\\nthe arbitrator's terms of reference do not specifically include this\\nconsideration, there is nothing to prevent employees arguing it, once\\nbefore the arbitrator.

The objective was to reduce the cost of settlements in the short term and that was achieved.

I can see no logic in singling out for special treatment in the determination of cash limits for 1981-82 only those whose final staging of \"comparability\" settlements fell during 1980-81 (that is school, further education and university teachers).  In other words, we would be accused of deliberately penalising those whose comparability studies and settlements were either delayed for one reason or another outside their control or who accepted longer periods of staging for the payment of their award.\\n\\nHence while I entirely agree that we must set rules for the operation of cash limits in 1981-82 which seek to avoid further difficulties for us in the future, I do not think we should apply new rules retrospectively to settlements in the 1979/80 pay round.\\n\\nI am copying this letter to the Prime Minister, each member of E Committee and Sir Robert Armstrong.'}, {'Department_Justification': 'The letter mentions that the Scottish Office has a substantial interest in public sector pay negotiations in Scotland as well as England and Wales, indicating that this falls under the remit of the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland.', 'Departments': 'Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland', 'date': '1980-09-10', 'document-type': 'Letter', 'id': 188, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-182_0001_-91.jpg', 'recipient': 'W S Ryrie CB, HM Treasury', 'sender': 'Scottish Office', 'source': 'PREM 19-182/0001/-91.jpg', 'subject': 'Public sector pay', 'text': \"SCOTTISH OFFICE\\nWHITEHALL\\nLONDON SW1A 2AU\\n01-233 8229 or 7602\\n\\n10 September 1980\\n\\nCONFIDENTIAL\\n\\nW S Ryrie Esq CB\\nHM Treasury\\nParliament Street\\nLondon SW1P 3AG\\n\\nDear Bill\\nPUBLIC SECTOR PAY\\n\\nThank you for your letter of 11 August about the new arrangements for providing Ministers with regular information about developments on public sector pay.

Otherwise, since pay is almost 50% of the expenditure covered by cash limits, the PSBR will rise and the money supply can then only be controlled by the use of a very high MLR and other interest rates.\\n\\nAt present we still do not have what I have described as a \"real\" monetarist policy based on a low PSBR which only requires low rates of interest to control the money supply but a \"phoney\" monetarist policy with a high PSBR which demands high interest rates to control the money supply. This is difficult to distinguish from a real old-fashioned deflation.\\n\\nI am glad the importance of this crucial difference between the two ways of controlling the money supply now seems to be generally understood, but unless we get a grip on public sector pay, attempts to get our policy right will fail. I thought, therefore, I should send you this copy of an article covering related points which I wrote a short time ago.\\n\\nI understand that both Geoffrey and John accept the criticisms I make in the article about the present system of cash limits and public sector pay. In addition a further device for circumventing effective control has now emerged. We are told that Civil Service pay increases of more than 20% are to be brought within the cash limits by delaying the starting date for the increases. This is a dangerous subterfuge either it raises the base on which next years pay increases are calculated, or alternatively, if we continue with pay research and tight cash limits the gap between the two will get larger and larger and increasingly difficult to defend.\\n\\nAlthough some of the arguments I have put forward are now understood, I remain gravely concerned about the apparent lack of coordination of Government opposition to inflationary public sector pay claims.

Until we reach our decisions on cash limits, and in particular the pay elements in cash limits, on 30 October, we cannot give clear indications to pay negotiators on what the cash limit provision will be. Further, we must remember that though the pay element in cash limits for FY 1980-81 is 14 per cent, even for settlements which fall in the 1980-81 \"pay round\", we may wish to adjust this element, as we did last year, to conform with whatever decisions we take on 30 October (though this year the adjustment would be downwards rather than upwards).\\n\\nThis means that if the UK AEA were to go ahead and negotiate on the basis indicated in your E(EA) paper, they might well end up with a settlement in excess of our final decisions on cash limits for this financial year and next.\\n\\nI do not see why you should not be fairly open with the UK AEA on this problem.

They had before them his minute of 29 February.\\n\\nThe Chancellor said that the Treasury\\'s pre-budget forecast was suggesting a rather higher fall in output in the coming year than most outside forecasters, at the same time, the forecast for the PSBR on the assumption of unchanged tax rates was approximately £8.9 billion - which was perhaps rather lower than might have been expected from the output forecast; in the forecast to be published as FSBR, he intended to show a less depressed output path in line with outside forecasters; but he did not think it would be right to be more optimistic about the PSBR. It would be better to show a PSBR target which could be met rather than be overly optimistic and run the risk of having to introduce supplementary fiscal measures in the autumn. As between the different sectors in the economy, the forecast was showing a substantial shift of resources into the oil sector and into the personal sector, and away from the non-oil corporate sector. This was reflected in a worsening of non-oil corporate liquidity. One of the objectives of the budget must be to reverse this shift.\\n\\nAs far as the monetary stance was concerned, he was proposing to roll forward the target range of 7-11% per annum to April 1981, with June 1979 remaining as the base. Given the likely overshooting of the target range for this financial year, a roll forward on these lines would represent as tight a stance as could be readily contemplated; on the other hand, to go for a more relaxed target would not be credible to the markets. He believed that a PSBR of £8-9 billion would be consistent with the 7-11% roll forward. Thus, in aggregate terms he was proposing a \"no change\" budget.\\n\\nThe Chancellor went on to explain that to index all the specific income and expenditure tax points and rates would involve a reduction of income tax of some £2 billion and an increase in indirect taxes of some £1 billion. £1 billion from indirect taxes would add about 1% to the RPI. He had yet to decide what combination of specific duty increases to go for; but he did not think it would be right to do more than this in total.

As regards income tax, she does not believe a package which will bear most heavily on those in the £21-£5,000 income bracket is tenable; for in her view, it would severely aggravate wage pressures in the next pay round.\\n\\nFor similar reasons, she believes it would be most unwise to make significant concessions on capital taxes this year. Even if the income tax package can be made more equitable, she thinks that even the relatively modest proposals put forward by the Chancellor will be widely criticised as favouring the rich at a time when the less well off are having to face higher prescription charges, charges for school transport, higher charges for school meals, etc. The Prime Minister therefore suggests that the Chancellor should drop his main proposals on CGT and CIT, and confine his proposals to the minor changes mentioned in paragraph 7 of his minute of 7 March.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister agrees that the stamp duty proposals should not be scorned as a capital tax measure, and she agrees with the proposal to raise the thresholds by £5000.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister would like to have an early discussion with the Chancellor. As I mentioned to you, she would find it helpful to have some clear figures on the distributional effects of both the Chancellor's preferred income tax package, and possible alternatives.\"}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter discusses budget and tax policies, which fall under the remit of the HM Treasury, the government's economic and finance ministry.\", 'Departments': 'HM Treasury', 'date': '1978-03-15', 'document-type': 'Letter', 'id': 220, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-176_0001_-52.jpg', 'recipient': 'John Wiggins, Esq., H.M.

But she had doubts about the proposal to increase from 9 to 15 per cent the rate of interest by which the taxable benefit from an interest-free loan is measured. She was worried that the 15 per cent figure would give the impression that the Chancellor believed interest rates would stay as high as this; and if, as seemed likely, interest rates did begin to fall, a 15 per cent figure would seem inequitable. The Chancellor said that he would reconsider.\\n\\nStock Relief\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that she had read the note explaining the \"dips\" scheme which the Chancellor enclosed with his minute of 12 March. She was still not entirely happy with the proposed scheme. In her view, it would be better to announce the end of the contingent liability and couple this with a smaller allowance for stock relief for this year. The \"dips\" scheme would in effect involve double deferment, and it would be expensive in terms of staff time. The Chancellor responded that the question of contingent liability and the extent of the allowance for stock relief were being looked at as part of the review of Corporation Tax, and this would not be completed for some time. In addition the company sector needed the immediate liquidity relief which the \"dips\" scheme would provide.

The assets under discussion are the commercial and industrial properties owned by the various 'New Towns'.  We are not talking about their residential property.

The benefit of domestic sales of BP shares is probably much less, because they will be taken up as a significant extent by Pension Funds and Life Offices, crowding out other purchases of equities or gilts.

However this still leaves a substantial remainder of unplanted land owned by the Commission. This will no doubt be covered by Michael Heseltine\\'s exercise on surplus land but given the rather special characteristics of the Commission\\'s land, and the particular problems and policy implications involved in selling it, I thought it right to ask you and the other Forestry Ministers (to whom I am copying this letter) for your views in advance of Thursday\\'s E (DL) meeting.\\n\\nThe first requirement, it seems to me, is to establish in consultation with the Commission exactly how much unplanted land the Commission owns and how marketable it is. According to the Commission\\'s last published accounts at 31 March 1978 it had 307,000 hectares of land in its plantable reserve and a further 67,000 hectares of other unplanted land. The value of all this land, plus the buildings on it was then assessed at nearly £75 million, of which \"surplus estate\" mainly agricultural and grazing land, accounted for about £10 million. These figures clearly need updating, and I should be surprised if, after recent land price rises, the total value of the Commission\\'s estate (excluding the plantations) did not come up with a surplus estate value considerably higher than £10 million. It would be helpful if we could then estimate how much of this surplus estate we might realise and by a business like effort to dispose of it.\\n\\nI recognise of course that it is already Forestry Commission policy to sell of its surplus estate. However the second proposal which I should like you to consider is somewhat more radical. This relates to the division between surplus and non-surplus land (including the miscellaneous land) and their valuation. One did not come up with a surplus estate value considerably higher than £10 million. It would be helpful if we could then estimate how much of this surplus estate we might realise and by a business like effort to dispose of it.\\n\\nI recognise of course that it is already Forestry Commission policy to sell of its surplus estate. However the second proposal which I should like you to consider is somewhat more radical. This relates to the division between surplus and non-surplus land (including the miscellaneous land) and their valuation. One could argue that the distinction between surplus and non-surplus is quite artificial and that we should look at the Forestry Commission\\'s entire land holding, decide what land we really need to retain for forestry purposes, and then dispose of the rest, surplus or not, at the best price we can get. This would involve a major review of the Forestry Commission\\'s land holdings, but I believe it is a review which is overdue and which could yield significant returns. The resources thereby generated could then be used to improve and expand the Commission\\'s forestry activities in line with government policies.'}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter discusses the disposal of new town assets, which falls under the remit of the Treasury as they are responsible for public sector land and building disposals and managing the government's finances.\", 'Departments': 'HM Treasury', 'date': '1979-07-02', 'document-type': 'letter', 'id': 255, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-31_0001_-91.jpg', 'recipient': 'T.

The Financial Secretary has also asked about schemes of this sort (Mrs Diggle's minute of 29 May).\\n\\n2. A point to note immediately about such a scheme is that sale of convertible gilts for this purpose would not in itself cause a reduction in the PSBR, but rather would count as a financing transaction. The PSBR would only be reduced (assuming, as with BP, that the equity sale itself did constitute a PSBR reduction) when the shares were actually handed over.* Thus although the monetary effects of a scheme of this sort would be very little different from those of an immediate sale of the shares the PSBR effect would be delayed until the option to convert was exercised.\\n\\n3. A claim made for the issue of convertible gilts is that the shares (or the gilts) could be sold at a premium rather than at a discount in the case of direct sale of the shares. But in fact this is only likely to be true if convertibility is optional. In this case there is a chance that the investor will make a capital gain because the share price might rise above the option price, whereas if the share price fell the option to buy need not be exercised. Thus the investors would have a one-way option for which they would probably be prepared to pay. But an implication of this is that if the share price did fall the sale of shares might never occur.\\n\\n4. If the conversion into shares were made compulsory within a certain period, the effect on the price obtainable by the Government is less clear cut and although a premium might be obtained this would be far less than with optional convertibility.\"}, {'Department_Justification': 'The letter discusses the sale of British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders to the private sector, which falls under the remit of the Department for Business and Trade as it is responsible for supporting businesses and economic growth.', 'Departments': 'Department for Business and Trade', 'date': '1979-07-19', 'document-type': 'Letter', 'id': 274, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-31_0001_-24.jpg', 'recipient': 'Martin Hall Esq, Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer', 'sender': 'Department of Industry', 'source': 'PREM 19-31/0001/-24.jpg', 'subject': 'Sale of British Aerospace and Warship Builders to the Private Sector', 'text': \"CONFIDENTIAL\\n\\nDEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY\\nASHDOWN HOUSE\\n123 VICTORIA STREET\\nLONDON SW1E 6RB\\nTELEPHONE: DIRECT LINE 01-212 3301\\nSWITCHBOARD: 01-212 7076\\n\\nPS/ Secretary of State for Industry\\n\\nMartin Hall Esq\\nPrivate Secretary to the\\nChancellor of the Exchequer\\nHM Treasury\\nTreasury Chambers\\nWhitehall\\nLondon SW1\\n\\nDear Martin,\\n\\nSALE OF BRITISH AEROSPACE AND WARSHIP BUILDERS TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR\\n\\nFollowing today's E(DL) policy approval for my Secretary of State's proposals on the sale of British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders to the private sector, my Secretary of State has asked me to circulate the text of the statement which, after consultation with the office of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, we propose should be made on Monday.

As you know, a comparable statement on British Aerospace\\nwill be made next week, and there is a possibility of the two\\nbeing closely compared. While I in general see no difficulty\\nabout your statement, there are two points where I should be\\ngrateful if some change might be made.\\n\\nThe first arises from your reference to employee shares, which\\nis couched in terms of your preference for offering shares on\\nfavourable terms. I wonder whether you would consider a slight\\nredrafting, to reflect both the Government\\'s determination to\\nsee some special arrangements for employees, without suggesting\\nhowever that these will necessarily be at a preferred price,\\nwhich may not be easy to arrange. I have in mind something on\\nthe lines of \"Special arrangements will be made to allow\\nemployees of British Airways to take up shares in the new company\\nso that they can participate in its future and share in its\\ngrowth.\" If you are content with this formulation, I should use\\na similar phrase in my own statement on British Aerospace.\\n\\nThe second point arises in relation to your description of\\nconsultations. As you know from my letter of 5 July, I am\\nconsulting directly with the trade unions involved in British\\nAerospace on our policy. I do not believe that this, a matter\\nof Government policy, is principally a subject for consultation\\nfor the British Aerospace Board; nor that consultation on this\\ncuts across the proper relations between Board and trade unions\\non those questions which are for the Corporation. I should\\ntherefore be unhappy if your statement were to say, as the present\\ndraft does, that your directly analogous consultations are\\nprinciPally a matter for the British Airways Board. I should\\nvery much prefer, therefore, for your sixth point to read simply:\\n\"Sixth, I envisage the fullest possible process of consultation\\nwith the airline\\'s management and employees. I will be glad to\\nmeet representatives of the trade unions concerned.\"\\n\\nI am copying this to those who received copies of your letter.\\n\\nEam McCaw'}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter discusses matters related to government asset disposals, including the potential sale of BP shares and BNOC assets, which fall under the remit of the HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry.\", 'Departments': 'HM Treasury', 'date': '1979-06-27', 'document-type': 'letter', 'id': 280, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-31_0001_-106.jpg', 'recipient': 'T Lankester Esq\\nPS/Prime Minister\\n10 Downing Street\\nLONDON\\nSW1', 'sender': 'Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street, SWIP 3AG', 'source': 'PREM 19-31/0001/-106.jpg', 'subject': 'DISPOSAL OF ASSETS', 'text': \"Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street, SWIP 3AG\\n\\nT Lankester Esq\\nPS/Prime Minister\\n10 Downing Street\\nLONDON\\nSW1\\n\\nDear Tim,\\n\\nDISPOSAL OF ASSETS\\n\\nThe Financial Secretary has seen your letter of 25 June to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Private Secretary in which you report that the Prime Minister would like to take the chair at a meeting of E(DL) Committee to consider the question of timing of the sale of BP shares and possible alternative sales.\\n\\nIn the light of this the Financial Secretary is preparing a paper on disposals generally for discussion by E(DL) next week; the paper will discuss a BP sale and other disposals which might be possible this year.\\n\\nOne such possibility is the disposal of BNOC assets - following the Chancellor's letter to the Secretary of State for Energy of 11 June, at least £200m is contemplated from this source as a contribution towards the £lbn mentioned in the Budget speech. The disposal of BNOC assets is, of course, intimately connected with Government's future plans for BNOC, on which I understand that the Secretary of State for Energy plans to submit a paper to E(EA) Committee next week, probably Tuesday or Wednesday. The Financial Secretary thinks that in view of the close link between the future of BNOC and the disposals exercises generally, it would be helpful if the Secretary of State tabled his paper to E(DL), rather than to E(EA).

To reach your local it would therefore be necessary for local authorities to make further cuts in schools expenditure. But there is evidence both in the report by our officials which I circulated on 4 July and in the report which is about to go to the Consultative Council from the Expenditure Steering Group - Education that additional resources are needed there if the quality of education is to be maintained.

One important piece of the jigsaw will be the decision on 1981-82 RSG - a final view on volume and a decision on the inflation factors to apply there and for all the other cash limits.

We really must leave ourselves adequate time, after our return from the Party Conference, to get 1980 PESC decisions right given that they will be absolutely crucial to the success of our strategy over this Parliament.

I have been thinking about the correspondence between you and Frank Cooper and others, about the release of Suez records, and a point has occurred to me to which you may like to consider further.\\n\\n2. It concerns the passage in your letter of 30 June to Frank, where you note that, over the release of the Suez papers, there may be more cases than usual when Departments might find it necessary to take the views of their Ministers. In point of fact, Ministers - in this Department at least - seem rarely, if ever, to have been consulted about the release of documents to the public domain. One reason for this is no doubt the convention by which Ministers do not have access to the papers of a previous Administration of a different political complexion. If this convention were to be strictly applied over the release of the Suez records, then reference to Ministers could mean either that the convention were flouted or that we would be pursuing different courses of action depending upon which Party was in power at the time.\\n\\n3. Much will depend upon the nature of the documents concerned, but I can see that it might prove necessary to take the view of Ministers in certain cases. I should have thought however that, in such cases of doubt, it would be best if in the first instance you were alerted by the Department affected so that you could then decide whether to seek the views of Ministers and if so how. It would seem preferable to act in this way rather than for officials in the various Departments to seek the views of Departmental Ministers in a piecemeal fashion before you had been consulted.\\n\\nMichael Palliser\\n\\ncc:\\nSir Frank Cooper GCB CMG\\nMINISTRY OF DEFENCE\\n\\nSir Douglas Wass GCB\\nHM TREASURY\\n\\nPERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL'}, {'Department_Justification': \"The Cabinet Office provides support to the Prime Minister and ensures the effective running of government.

Although officials may normally act for Ministers in submitting recommendations to the Lord Chancellor about extended closure, this statutory provision confers a duty upon Ministers to give approvals or a right upon them to make requests; and that must surely mean that the possibility of their being consulted cannot be excluded.\\n\\nIn my letter of 30th June I was not intending to suggest that the arrangements for reviewing the Suez records should be different from those customarily employed.

As Frank says, this would help to ensure consistency of treatment.\\n\\nIn this connection I am not too troubled by the convention by which Ministers do not have access to the papers of a previous Administration of a different political complexion, although, if the question of consulting Ministers about Suez papers arose during the term of office of a Labour Government, compliance with that convention could well require the Prime Minister of the day to consult the Leader of the Opposition before a Departmental Minister was consulted.'}, {'Department_Justification': 'The letter is from the Secretary of the Cabinet, which is part of the Cabinet Office, and it is discussing the review of Suez records, which falls within the remit of the Cabinet Office as it coordinates the work of government departments.', 'Departments': 'Cabinet Office', 'date': '1980-10-01', 'document-type': 'Letter', 'id': 325, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19_0001_-19.jpg', 'recipient': 'Sir Michael Palliser, GCMG', 'sender': 'Sir Robert Armstrong K.C.B.

To avoid any misunderstanding I am writing now to inform you and the Treasury and Civil Service Committee of two further specific points; and I am releasing this letter to the press.\\n\\nFirst, the prospective increase in the paybill between financial years.  In particular cash limits on Total, the actual percentage increase between 1980-81 and 1981-82 in the provision for pay will differ from the announced provision for the increase in earnings from due settlement dates.  The number employed may change.  In some cases the settlement date is not 1 April, so that each financial year will include a period at the rate before and a period at the rate after the due settlement date.  In addition, the increase in the provision for pay between 1980-81 and 1981-82 will be affected in some cases by settlements having been staged in 1980-81, with increases paid later than the usual settlement dates, but such staging not being repeated in 1981-82.  This last will contribute some 1 per cent to the increase in the total public service paybill between the two years.\\n\\nSecond, staging:  The staging of awards has in the past resulted in a higher rate of pay being carried forward into subsequent years than otherwise would have been consistent with the cash limit.  This erodes the effectiveness of the cash limit system and confuses comparisons of the growth of earnings.'}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter is addressed to the Prime Minister and discusses government strategy, which falls under the remit of the Prime Minister's Office at 10 Downing Street.\", 'Departments': \"Prime Minister's Office, No. 10 Downing Street\", 'date': '1980-12-22', 'document-type': 'Letter', 'id': 335, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-174_0001_-11.jpg', 'recipient': 'Prime Minister', 'sender': 'John Hoskyns', 'source': 'PREM 19-174/0001/-11.jpg', 'subject': 'Government Strategy', 'text': 'PRIME MINISTER\\n\\nGOVERNMENT STRATEGY\\n\\nAs promised, I attach a paper reviewing\\nGoverment strategy to date.\\n\\nI am copying this minute and the paper to\\nGeoffrey Howe and Keith Joseph.\\n\\nJOHN HOSKYNS'}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter appears to be from the Treasury Chambers, which indicates that the matter falls under the remit of HM Treasury, the government's economic and finance ministry.\", 'Departments': 'HM Treasury', 'date': 'N/A', 'document-type': 'letter', 'id': 336, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-174_0001_-337.jpg', 'recipient': 'Mr Lankester', 'sender': 'J B UNWIN', 'source': 'PREM 19-174/0001/-337.jpg', 'subject': 'with compliments', 'text': 'SECRET & PERSONAL\\n\\nYour Ref\\nMr Lankester\\n\\nwith compliments\\n\\nJ B UNWIN\\n\\nTreasury Chambers\\nParliament Street\\nLondon SW1P 3AG\\nTel: Direct Line 01-233-3016\\nSwitchboard 01-233-3000'}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter is addressed to Robin Ibbs, who is from the Cabinet Office.

The text of the letter is as follows:\\n\\n'My statement today covers certain general aspects of the 1981-82 cash limits relating to pay in the public services. To avoid any misunderstanding I am writing now to inform you and the Treasury and Civil Service Committee of two further specific points; and I am releasing this letter to the press.\\n\\nFirst, the prospective increase in the paybill between financial years. In particular cash limits or Votes the actual percentage increase between 1980-81 and 1981-82 in the provision for pay will differ from the announced provision for the increase in earnings from due settlement dates. The number employed may change. In some cases the settlement date is not 1 April, so each financial year will include a period at the rate before and a period at the rate after the due settlement date. In addition, the increase in the provision for pay between 1980-81 and 1981-82 will be affected in some cases by settlements having been staged in 1980-81 with increases paid later than the usual settlement dates, but such staging not being repeated in 1981-82. This last will contribute some 1% to the increase in the total public service payroll between the two years.\\n\\nSecond, staging. The staging of awards has in the past resulted in a higher rate of pay being carried forward into subsequent years than otherwise would have been consistent with the cash limit. This erodes the effectiveness of the cash limit system and confuses the comparisons of the growth of earnings.\\n\\nThe Government therefore thinks it desirable for the future to avoid the delay or staging of awards, and will avoid it where it is itself the employer. If, this general policy notwithstanding, a public services employer were to delay or stage an award, the Government, when setting the relevant cash limits for the subsequent year, would not allow for the element of the award which had only been made compatible with the cash limit by such delay or staging.'\"}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter discusses policy options to mitigate adverse conditions for British industry, particularly in relation to the financial pressures caused by the government's policy to slow down the rate of inflation.

It is important to establish at the outset the nature of the problem which we wish to resolve. The strong financial pressure to which business generally is subjected is one manifestation of the policy which is intended to slow down the rate of inflation. I have never myself believed that the statement of the commitment to a deceleration in monetary growth would, through expectations, lead rapidly and as it were on its own account to a fall in wage settlements. In time expectations could well play an important part but until they do, the pressures on wage bargainers and price fixers has to be through powerful financial and economic forces - in short an inability of the customer (employer) to afford the goods or services in question at the price that would otherwise be offered.\\n\\n4. It seems to me that the success we have been, and can look forward to, having on the inflation front stems directly from this. To appeal therefore for a relief from these financial pressures is implicitly to appeal against the policy being pursued, or at any rate to appeal to amend it.'}, {'Department_Justification': \"The letter discusses the potential impact of increased National Insurance Contributions on employees' take-home pay and future pay negotiations, which is within the remit of the HM Treasury as the government's economic and finance ministry responsible for taxation policy.\", 'Departments': 'HM Treasury', 'date': '1980-12-15', 'document-type': 'Letter', 'id': 345, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-174_0001_-76.jpg', 'recipient': 'Rt Hon Sir Geoffrey Howe QC MP', 'sender': 'Carton House Tothill Street London SW1H 9NA', 'source': 'PREM 19-174/0001/-76.jpg', 'subject': 'Effects of increased National Insurance Contributions on pay bargaining', 'text': \"CONFIDENTIAL\\n\\nCarton House Tothill Street London SW1H 9NA\\nTelephone Direct Line 01-213 6400\\nSwitchboard 01-213 3000\\nGTN Code 213\\n\\nRt Hon Sir Geoffrey Howe QC MP\\nChancellor of the Exchequer\\nTreasury\\nGreat George Street\\nLONDN\\nSW1P 3AG\\n\\nDear Geoffrey\\n\\nEFFECTS OF INCREASED NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS ON PAY BARGAINING\\n\\nThe increased National Insurance Contributions payable by employees from next April, which you recently announced, and which are provided for in the National Insurance (Contributions) Bill, will have a significant effect on employees' take home pay and on the Tax and Prices Index; and we need to bear in mind the potential effects on future pay negotiations.\\n\\nI attach some examples which have been sent to me by a company which has recently concluded a wage negotiation in the 17% range. As you will see the combined effect of tax and the new NI contributions will be to claw back about half of the negotiated increases. The changes bear most heavily on the craftsmen. In the case of example B the employee concerned will, as from April, take home only £7.62 of his prior increase of £16 a week. In other words over 52% of his pay increase is lost to him.\\n\\nThe company is worried that once the size of the claw back is fully understood by trade union officials and by individual employees, there will be pressure for the settlements to be re-opened. They also fear that it will be harder to single figure settlements in future. We may find these attitudes reflected more widely. You will no doubt remember that after the miners' ballot was known, that the result would be significantly affected by the announcement about increased NI contributions.\\n\\nI am not, of course, suggesting that we should reconsider decisions on increasing NI contributions on the NIL unless we find ourselves obliged to do so by our own back benchers.

He had in mind a reduction in MLR of 2 per cent. To enable this to take place, he would need to be able to demonstrate that the Government was not abandoning the monetary strategy, and he would therefore need to announce in his speech in the Debate on the Addresses a credible package of measures. His intention was to announce a further extension of Granny bonds and a probably a restricted indexed gilt, the outcome of the current public expenditure review, the external financing limits for the nationalised industries in 1981/82, an increase in PRT and the increase in employee contributions in about £1 billion in 1981/82, and an increase in employee national insurance contribution. He would also have to announce the roll forward of the monetary target and the Government's conclusions on the monetary and fiscal stance against the background of the Industry Act forecast which would be published at the same time. Final decisions still had to be taken on most of these matters; he hoped that - even though the conclusions on public expenditure was likely to be disappointing - the various measures taken together would produce a setting in which the 2 per cent MLR reduction could be recognised that it would involve a considerable element of risk: questions would be raised as to whether the Government was doing enough to get the fiscal balance right, and these doubts would have to be even more restrictive; alternatively, it might conceivably be necessary to put MLR up again.\\n\\nAs regards the other options, the Chancellor said that he had concluded that option I - i.e. inflationary controls - should not be adopted alongside a reduction in MLR. The two together would give the impression that the Government was moving to an exchange rate objective. But if it turned out that the MLR reduction was not possible, it would probably be necessary to announce a package of inflow controls to show that the Government was 'doing something', even though the Chancellor did not think that they would have any significant effect.

She had told the Governor in December that she agreed very reluctantly to the proposal to appoint Mr. McMahon to be Deputy Governor in succession to Sir Jasper Hollom, but since then she had seen much more of the individuals concerned in connection with the question of Sir Jasper Hollom's position. In that context Sir Jasper Hollom had stood head and shoulders above all the other representatives of the Bank, including Mr. McMahon. He had shown himself to be both steady and decisive in a difficult situation. She had been surprised to learn that he was only 62, and she did not believe that we could afford to let him go. She would much prefer that rather than appoint Mr. McMahon, Sir Jasper Hollom should continue as Deputy Governor.\\n\\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, following his talk with the Prime Minister, the Governor was now planning a number of staff appointments on the assumption that Mr. McMahon would become Deputy Governor, and it was likely that it would cause considerable difficulty if the earlier decision that Mr. McMahon should succeed Sir Jasper Hollom was now reversed. Personally, he thought better of Mr. McMahon than did the Prime Minister. Nonetheless, he would now see the Governor to let him know that the Prime Minister wished Sir Jasper Hollom to be kept on. It might be necessary for the Prime Minister to see Mr. Richardson herself. The Chancellor said that she was very ready to do this.\\n\\nClegg: Nurses' Pay\\n\\nThe Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that the Press announcement about the Clegg award on nurses' pay should not contain any mention of increasing cash limits in order to accommodate the cost of the pay award, lest this should have repercussions on the present steel dispute.

It does seem that this is an area where, though I can see the difficulties, bold measures would make a huge difference. I realise this is rather academic now, but one could think of announcing a planned increase - or a range of increases - of rents, to bring them into line with the reality over 3 years - ie over TIME.

The Budget presentation could be a way of doing that, of helping people to understand that we live in an uncertain world. \\n\\nIn the past, the convention is that Chancellors insult people\\'s intelligence by treating them as if the world is certain, and the Chancellor is Father Christmas handing out goodies to a lot of goodies - you know the sort of thing, \"this year, I have tried to do a little more to help such and such a group\".

I have no later information.\\n\\nClearly, if the Prime Minister is concerned that the tax system is in some way encouraging excessive company borrowing and pushing up interest rates, this should be fed into the Revenue's review.  However, it is not easy to draft a note for Number 10 without being certain what precise problem the Prime Minister has in mind.\\n\\nFirstly there is the question of whether we actually have more borrowing than is desirable.  Others will be more competent to comment than I, but I had always understood British companies borrowed rather less than our more successful competitors.  I gather the Prime Minister's concern is that the tax system encourages companies to borrow more than they otherwise would, and that, if the money supply is to be held steady, this leads to interest rates higher than they would otherwise have been, which penalizes non-borrowers (especially mortgage payers).  It is important to bear in mind that if this effect exists it cannot be harming business investment.  Put another way, if a tax penalty is placed on borrowing firms will be forced to deal with bills which are as high as if the tax system had been left unchanged and interest rates had gone up.  So one is effectively penalizing firms to help house buyers.  Moreover, it must be doubtful in a world without exchange controls whether reducing UK company demand for funds will significantly reduce interest rates.\\n\\nPerhaps more important for the Revenue, however, is to know what balancing adjustment we want companies to make to compensate for reduced borrowing.  They could reduce their investment - principally in capital assets or stocks.

You will now have heard the precise details of our Budget proposals. We have carried out our Election pledges to reduce substantially the burden of income tax: our cuts overall (in addition to those enacted by the 'caretaker' Finance Act in April) total £21 billion in 1979/80, and take an additional 1 million people out of the tax net.\\n\\nTo pay for these cuts, we have always made it clear that we would have to increase indirect taxation. We have concentrated these increases on VAT. VAT is not a regressive tax: it covers about one half of consumers' expenditure and does not apply to necessities like food, children's clothing, domestic heating and lighting, public transport and housing.\\n\\nThe other major indirect tax increase was in the duties on hydro-carbon oil. Clearly, in view of the current difficulties in oil supplies, we could not leave these duties unchanged, but we did exclude paraffin, which is widely used by the less well-off for domestic heating, from the increase. The duty on petrol is in any case not particularly regressive: the table attached (which is being published in the June Supplement to the Treasury's Economic Progress Report) shows that the petrol and VAT increases together will form a lower proportion of their expenditure for those on lower incomes.\\n\\nI hope this explanation helps to clarify the position.

But that I now think would be wrong.  This letter needs to be straightforward and to the point, and I would ask you all to read it and then discuss it with your colleagues throughout your organisation.  My reason for asking this is as follows:\\n\\nEvery one of us knows that we are entering a crucial period in the UK.  We have a Government which, in its Budget, has set out to do many of the things that on the personal incentives front we have so long argued for.  They have taken risks, but they have been bold and courageous.  They have been bold in dealing with the Price Commission.  I believe too, that they intend to move firmly on the Industrial Relations front.  If they don't, they will get pushed very sharply by the CBI!\\n\\nSo at last we have a Government which is intent on giving us - managers, employers and shopfloor - many of the conditions for which we have asked; and they are going to ask us all - as they are entitled to - how we are going to respond.\\n\\nHow can we - each of us - respond? At its meeting on Wednesday last week the CBI Council responded by passing the following resolution (and the CBI Council very rarely passes resolutions!):\\n\\n'This Council fully supports the strategy and the direction of the Budget and recognises that its success will hinge to a large extent on the ability of managers and employees throughout business to respond to the challenge and the incentives it provides.  The CBI Council therefore calls on all CBI member firms to do everything in their power through the efficient and competitive management of their enterprises to ensure that the policies, which the CBI has long advocated and which are now being pursued by the Government, lead to higher productivity, higher living standards, more jobs and a more successful economy, in the interests of the British people as a whole.'\\n\\nThe CBI, as I well know, has no power or right, of its own initiative, to make promises on behalf of its membership.  It is not something I would ever attempt.  But we have learned to act and fight together over the last three years when it matters most.  And it matters most now.\"}, {'Department_Justification': 'The letter is regarding a request for information on the yield of Corporation Tax in 1978/79, specifically the amount from manufacturing companies.

This gave a figure of £35 million. The Scots argued for calculating the reduction on the 1979/80 ratio which is used for dealing with the England and Wales:Scotland shares of comparable R80 programmes, which would have given a cut of £22 million for the Scots. As a compromise, which the Scots accepted, the figure of £35 million was put to Cabinet.\\n\\n3. In fact Cabinet agreed that the cut for England and Wales should be £700 million, which would have given a figure proportionately, of £374 million for Scotland. With the agreement of the Scots, this was rounded down to £35 million because, given the underlying calculation, a figure of £374 million would have looked too precise and would have been difficult to justify publicly.

I share your reservations about the situation, especially in present conditions, and I understand that you want to keep the forecast to as minute a circle as possible at this time. Nevertheless, I hope you will agree that I may see the forecasts submitted to you, as I did last Summer though not in the Autumn.  I should not be surprised if the forecast indicated a significantly higher earnings and price level increases than in the Industry Act Forecast, and a substantially sharper fall in GDP and - more especially - in manufacturing output. The consequences of such trends for corporate liquidity would be very serious and I return to that below.\\n\\nI understand and strongly share your concern at the likely side of the PSBR, which will be aggravated by the effects of the steel strike, by the adverse trends in earnings, prices and activity suggested above, if they materialise, and by the lower expected output from the North Sea. The effects on interest rates if a PSBR of £10-11bn had to be financed would be deeply worrying.   I assume from our discussions in Cabinet that the greater part, if not the whole, of the further public expenditure cuts together with sales of assets and any reduction in our EBQ contribution will go to reduce the PSBR; and that there will be little if any headroom for net tax reductions - indeed quite possibly the reverse.\\n\\nThe corporate liquidity situation seems to me of pivotal importance. Pressure on corporate liquidity is, of course, one of the mechanisms by which our monetary policy is intended to operate in inflation expectations and wage demands. But there may come a point at which that pressure entails unacceptable damage in two areas - the chances of survival of potentially viable parts of our industrial structure (which we must be careful not to jeopardise), and the stability of the financial system itself.

We are determined to encourage as many home owners as possible to let their rooms and thus combat housing shortages. Two main changes are proposed to boost resident landlordlettings and tap the sub-stantial pool of under-used accommodation in owner-occupied homes. The first is that for new lettings a notice to quit may no longer be suspended by the rent tribunal and no possession order may be postponed for more than 3 months. Second, a landlord will be able to grant consecutive fixed-term tenancies without creating fully protected tenancies. One remaining disincentive to letting, however, is the continuing threat to resident landlords of liability for CGT on the sale of their homes - they are not treated as businessmen when it comes to claiming capital allowances, yet the situation is reversed as soon as there is a possibility of sharing capital gains tax. The estimated cost of exemption from CGT for resident landlords is minimal i.e. £0.5m, yet its psychological impact would be great. In addition the public expenditure costs will be reduced each time a landlord who would otherwise be on the local authorities' waiting list. For example the present cost of providing a local authority home for 2 people is £8,000. On the other hand, if such a couple were to be housed by a resident landlord the net result could be a gain to the public purse of income tax on the rent received. I would be grateful if you could let me have your initial views on the possibilities of this exemption, particularly as the matter is quite likely to be raised again during the course of the Housing Bill, following Nick Scott's reference to it on Second Reading and given the steady amount of correspondence we have received on this issue.

I should have liked\\nnothing better than to witness your great day.\\n\\nThe problem, which I imagine you understand very well\\nalready, is that a Chancellor has in practice very little\\nroom for manoeuvre in his choice of Budget Day.  The sheer\\nmechanics of the operation - the physical production of\\nthe speech, final consultations with colleagues and so\\non - make Tuesday very much the best day, as successive\\nChancellors have found.\\n\\nBut even if Tuesday is based on much more than\\ntradition, why pick on your Tuesday? Ironically enough\\nmy choice has been very much influenced by the dictates of\\nthe ecclesiastical calendar.  We need to set the Budget\\ndate as close as possible to the end of March;  delays could\\nmean lost revenue, while advancing the date means that we\\nare without important information about the year just gone.\\nWith the Tuesday before Easter, and the two succeeding\\nTuesdays more or less ruled out, 25th March was in effect\\nour only option.\\n\\nThe problem does become a little easier in years when\\nEaster is late.  My impression is that Easter in the\\nOrthodox Church is never earlier than in Western Christendom,\\n\\nand that'}, {'Department_Justification': 'The letter is from the Treasury Chambers, and it is regarding the announcement of the date of the Budget, which is a key responsibility and function of HM Treasury.', 'Departments': 'HM Treasury', 'date': '1980-01-14', 'document-type': 'Letter', 'id': 429, 'image_url': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-images-correspondance/PREM_19-175_0001_-106.jpg', 'recipient': 'T.P.

As you know, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor last Thursday had a brief discussion about the best date for announcing this, in light of the fact that it coincides with the date of installation of the new Archbishop of Canterbury.\\n\\nThe Chancellor has now considered this further and has concluded that there is no good reason for holding back on an announcement. In these circumstances the Chancellor feels that it would be sensible for him to tell Cabinet about the date of the Budget next Thursday, 17th January, and have an announcement in Parliament that afternoon.\\n\\nThe usual method for making the announcement in Parliament is for the Leader of the House to give the information in reply to a question by the Leader of the Opposition (prompted by the Chief Whip) on the Thursday Business Statement. It would seem sensible to follow this course next Thursday.\\n\\nI am copying this letter to John Stevens and Murdo Maclean.\\n\\nYours ever\\n\\n(A.J.
